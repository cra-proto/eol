               <p>Donations made by will and designation donations are deemed to be made by the individual's estate after the death. These types of donations are deemed to be made at the time at which the donation is transferred to the donee.</p>
               <p>A <strong>designation donation</strong> is a donation of a direct distribution of proceeds to a qualified donee from an RRSP (including a group RRSP), RRIF, a tax-free savings account (TFSA), or a life insurance policy (including a group life insurance policy) as a result of a beneficiary designation.</p>

               <h3>Report capital gains or losses if donated after the date of death</h3>
               <p>If the estate donates property and the property's fair market value upon transfer to the qualified donee has increased or decreased since the disposition reported in the final return, the gain or loss in value will generally be recognized for income tax purposes. This applies both to Graduated Rate Estates and former Graduated Rate Estates.</p>
               <details>
                  <summary>Donating certified cultural property</summary>
                  <p>If the property is certified cultural property or ordinarily benefits from a capital gains inclusion rate of zero, see the sections called “Gifts of certified cultural property” and “Capital gains realized on gifts of certain capital property” in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html">Pamphlet&nbsp;P113, Gifts and Income Tax</a>. The same treatment will apply to the capital gains on the deemed disposition of the property immediately before the individual’s death if the property donated meets both of the following conditions:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The&nbsp;property benefits from a capital gains exemption or exclusion when donated as described in the sections of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html">Pamphlet P113</a> referenced above.</li>
                     <li>The estate is a GRE and the donation is a GRE donation.</li>
                  </ul>   
               </details>
               
               <p>This treatment will also apply to former <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donations.</p>
               <p>Additional special rules exist for the proceeds of disposition and cost amount of gifts of art, from the artist’s inventory, on and as a consequence of the artist’s death.</p>
                  




               <p><abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donations are donations by a GRE to a qualified donee. The donated property must be property that was acquired by the estate on and as a consequence of the death (or property that was substituted for such property). <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donations include those made through the will and designation donations.</p>
               <p>You can allocate a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donation among any of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the taxation year of the <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> in which the donation is made</li>
               <li>an earlier taxation year of the <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE </abbr></li>
               <li>the last two taxation years of the deceased individual (the final return and the return for the preceding year)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>In addition,&nbsp;a gift made after the 36-month period but within 60 months after the date of death by a former <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> that continues to meet all of the requirements of a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> except for the 36-month time limit, can be allocated among&nbsp;any of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the taxation year of the estate in which the donation is made</li>
               <li>an earlier taxation year of the estate if the estate was a GRE in that preceding year</li>
               <li>the last two taxation years of the deceased individual (the final return and the return for the preceding year)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>An estate, whether it is a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> or not, can claim a charitable donations tax credit for an estate donation in the year in which the donation is made or in any of the&nbsp;5 following years (or 10 years for a gift of certified ecologically sensitive land made after February 10, 2014).</p>
               <p>As the legal representative, you must attach supporting documentation for the donations made. The type of supporting documentation you have to provide depends on when the registered charity or other qualified donee will receive the gift.</p>
               <p>For gifts that will be received right away, provide an official donation receipt.</p>
               <p>For gifts that will be received later, provide a copy of all of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the will</li>
               <li>a letter from the estate to the charitable organization that will receive the gift, advising of the gift, a description of the property being gifted and its estimated value</li>
               <li>a letter from the charitable organization acknowledging the gift and stating that it&nbsp;will accept the gift</li>
               <li>a statement or letter from the legal representative of the estate stating all of the following:<ul>
               <li>the estate is the graduated rate estate (GRE) of the deceased individual and will be designating itself as such</li>
               <li>the estate intends to make the gift within 60 months after the date of death</li>
               <li>the amount of the gift claimed on the final return of the deceased individual will not be claimed on any other return (of any estate of the deceased individual in any taxation year)</li>
               </ul>
               </li>
               </ul>

                        <p>Charitable donations cannot be carried forward from a T1 return to a T3 return.</p>  
                   
               <p>The amount of the gift(s) that may be claimed on the deceased’s final return for purposes of the tax credit may be up to whichever of the following amounts is <strong>less</strong>:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the <a href="#P97_6981">eligible amount of the gift(s)</a>,&nbsp;made in the year of death (this may include gifts made by a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> or a former <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr>), plus the unclaimed portion of the eligible amount of any gifts made in the five years before the year of death</li>
               <li>100% of the deceased's net income on <span class="nowrap"><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23600-net-income.html">line 23600</a></span> on the return</li>
               </ul>
               <p>For a gift of property made to a qualified donee, special rules may apply to limit the <a href="#P100_8108">fair market value (FMV)</a> of the property gifted, which limits the eligible amount of the gift that can be used in computing the donation tax credit amount. When the rules apply, the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> of the donated property will be deemed to be the <strong>lesser </strong>of the property's:</p>
               <ul>
               <li><abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> otherwise determined</li>
               <li>cost (or its <a href="#ACB">adjusted cost base</a>&nbsp;if it is capital property, or adjusted cost basis if it is a life insurance policy at the time the gift was made)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Fair market value and adjusted cost base (ACB) are defined in <a href="#P73_2055">Definitions</a>.</p>
               <p>The limitation on the eligible amount of a gift <strong>will </strong>apply where:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the donated property was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter</li>
               <li>the property is being gifted otherwise than as a consequence of the taxpayer's death, and the property was acquired less than <strong>3</strong> years, or in some cases, less than <strong>10</strong> years, before making the gift</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The limitation on the eligible amount of a gift will <strong>not</strong> apply to gifts of any of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>inventory</li>
               <li>real property or an immovable property located in Canada</li>
               <li>certified cultural property (unless it was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter)</li>
               <li>certified ecologically sensitive land including a covenant, an easement, or in the case of land in Quebec, a real servitude (or for gifts made after March 21, 2017, a personal servitude when certain conditions are met)</li>
               <li>a share, debt obligation, or right listed on a designated stock exchange</li>
               <li>a share of the capital stock of a mutual fund corporation</li>
               <li>a unit of a mutual fund trust</li>
               <li>an interest in a related segregated fund trust</li>
               <li>a prescribed debt obligation</li>
               <li>shares of controlled corporations in certain circumstances</li>
               </ul>
               <p>There are also special anti-avoidance rules that may apply where a taxpayer has attempted to avoid the application of the limitation rules. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html"><span class="nowrap">Pamphlet P113</span>, Gifts and Income Tax</a>.</p>
               <p>If the property was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter, the eligible amount will be reported in <span class="nowrap">box 13</span> of&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5003.html"><span class="nowrap">T5003 slip</span>, Statement of Tax Shelter Information</a>.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, a capital property is&nbsp;gifted. At the time the property is gifted to a qualified donee, its <a href="#P100_8108">FMV</a> may be more than its&nbsp;<a href="#ACB">ACB</a>.</p>
               <p>When the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> is <strong>more</strong> than the <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr>, you may designate an amount that is <strong>less</strong> than the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> to be the proceeds of disposition. This may allow you to reduce the capital gain otherwise calculated. If you choose to designate an amount that is less than the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> as the amount to be used as the proceeds of disposition, this amount will be used to determine&nbsp;the eligible amount of the donation. You can choose to designate an amount that is <strong>not greater than</strong> the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> and <strong>not less</strong> than the greater of:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>any <a href="#adv001">advantage</a> in respect of the gift</li>
               <li>the <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr> of the property (or, where the property was depreciable property, the lesser of its <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr> and the undepreciated capital cost of the class of the property), at the time you made the donation</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Treat the amount you choose as the proceeds of disposition when you calculate any capital gain.</p>
