               <h3>Claiming donations from up to 5 years before the date of death</h3>
               <p>The deceased may have donated amounts in the five years before the year of death. As long as the deceased did not previously claim the amounts, you can claim them in the year of death. Where part of a donation has already been claimed, attach a note to the return giving the amounts and the year or years the donations were made. Also, attach any receipts that were not attached to previous returns, if applicable.</p>

               <p>Donations made by will and designation donations are deemed to be made by the individual’s estate after the death. These types of donations are deemed to be made at the time at which the donation is transferred to the donee.</p>
               <p>A <strong>designation donation</strong> is a donation of a direct distribution of proceeds to a qualified donee from an RRSP (including a group RRSP), RRIF, a tax-free savings account (TFSA), or a life insurance policy (including a group life insurance policy) as a result of a beneficiary designation. It is not considered a designated donation, however, if the qualified donee is the policyholder or an assignee of the deceased person’s interest in the policy.</p>

               <p>For non-cash gifts, you must include the value of the future gift can be reasonably ascertained and supported</li>

               <p><abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donations are donations by a GRE to a qualified donee. The donated property must be property that was acquired by the estate on and as a consequence of the death (or property that was substituted for such property). <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donations include those made through the will and designation donations.</p>
               <p>You can allocate a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donation among any of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the taxation year of the <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> in which the donation is made</li>
               <li>an earlier taxation year of the <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE </abbr></li>
               <li>the last two taxation years of the deceased individual (the final return and the return for the preceding year)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>In addition,&nbsp;a gift made after the 36-month period but within 60 months after the date of death by a former <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> that continues to meet all of the requirements of a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> except for the 36-month time limit, can be allocated among&nbsp;any of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the taxation year of the estate in which the donation is made</li>
               <li>an earlier taxation year of the estate if the estate was a GRE in that preceding year</li>
               <li>the last two taxation years of the deceased individual (the final return and the return for the preceding year)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>An estate, whether it is a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> or not, can claim a charitable donations tax credit for an estate donation in the year in which the donation is made or in any of the&nbsp;5 following years (or 10 years for a gift of certified ecologically sensitive land made after February 10, 2014).</p>
               <p>As the legal representative, you must attach supporting documentation for the donations made. The type of supporting documentation you have to provide depends on when the registered charity or other qualified donee will receive the gift.</p>
               <p>For gifts that will be received right away, provide an official donation receipt.</p>
               <p>For gifts that will be received later, provide a copy of all of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the will</li>
               <li>a letter from the estate to the charitable organization that will receive the gift, advising of the gift, a description of the property being gifted and its estimated value</li>
               <li>a letter from the charitable organization acknowledging the gift and stating that it&nbsp;will accept the gift</li>
               <li>a statement or letter from the legal representative of the estate stating all of the following:<ul>
               <li>the estate is the graduated rate estate (GRE) of the deceased individual and will be designating itself as such</li>
               <li>the estate intends to make the gift within 60 months after the date of death</li>
               <li>the amount of the gift claimed on the final return of the deceased individual will not be claimed on any other return (of any estate of the deceased individual in any taxation year)</li>
               </ul>
               </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Generally, when an individual dies, the individual is deemed to have disposed of all capital property immediately before the individual’s death.</p>
               <p>Where the estate of an individual donates property that was the subject of a deemed disposition by the individual immediately before the individual’s death, and the property’s fair market value upon transfer to the qualified donee has changed, the difference will result in a gain or loss to the estate that will generally be recognized for income tax purposes. This will be the case whether or not the donation is a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donation or a former <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donation.</p>
               <p>If the property is certified cultural property or ordinarily benefits from a capital gains inclusion rate of zero, see the sections called “Gifts of certified cultural property” and “Capital gains realized on gifts of certain capital property” in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html">Pamphlet&nbsp;P113, Gifts and Income Tax</a>. The same treatment will apply to the capital gains on the deemed disposition of the property immediately before the individual’s death if the property donated meets both of the following conditions:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>The&nbsp;property benefits from a capital gains exemption or exclusion when donated as described in the sections of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html">Pamphlet P113</a> referenced above.</li>
               <li>The estate is a GRE and the donation is a GRE donation.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>This treatment will also apply to former <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> donations.</p>
               <p>Additional special rules exist for the proceeds of disposition and cost amount of gifts of art, from the artist’s inventory, on and as a consequence of the artist’s death.</p>
               
                        <p>Charitable donations cannot be carried forward from a T1 return to a T3 return.</p>  
                   
               <p>The amount of the gift(s) that may be claimed on the deceased’s final return for purposes of the tax credit may be up to whichever of the following amounts is <strong>less</strong>:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the <a href="#P97_6981">eligible amount of the gift(s)</a>,&nbsp;made in the year of death (this may include gifts made by a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> or a former <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr>), plus the unclaimed portion of the eligible amount of any gifts made in the five years before the year of death</li>
               <li>100% of the deceased's net income on <span class="nowrap"><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23600-net-income.html">line 23600</a></span> on the return</li>
               </ul>
               <p>For a gift of property made to a qualified donee, special rules may apply to limit the <a href="#P100_8108">fair market value (FMV)</a> of the property gifted, which limits the eligible amount of the gift that can be used in computing the donation tax credit amount. When the rules apply, the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> of the donated property will be deemed to be the <strong>lesser </strong>of the property's:</p>
               <ul>
               <li><abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> otherwise determined</li>
               <li>cost (or its <a href="#ACB">adjusted cost base</a>&nbsp;if it is capital property, or adjusted cost basis if it is a life insurance policy at the time the gift was made)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Fair market value and adjusted cost base (ACB) are defined in <a href="#P73_2055">Definitions</a>.</p>
               <p>The limitation on the eligible amount of a gift <strong>will </strong>apply where:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the donated property was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter</li>
               <li>the property is being gifted otherwise than as a consequence of the taxpayer's death, and the property was acquired less than <strong>3</strong> years, or in some cases, less than <strong>10</strong> years, before making the gift</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The limitation on the eligible amount of a gift will <strong>not</strong> apply to gifts of any of the following:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>inventory</li>
               <li>real property or an immovable property located in Canada</li>
               <li>certified cultural property (unless it was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter)</li>
               <li>certified ecologically sensitive land including a covenant, an easement, or in the case of land in Quebec, a real servitude (or for gifts made after March 21, 2017, a personal servitude when certain conditions are met)</li>
               <li>a share, debt obligation, or right listed on a designated stock exchange</li>
               <li>a share of the capital stock of a mutual fund corporation</li>
               <li>a unit of a mutual fund trust</li>
               <li>an interest in a related segregated fund trust</li>
               <li>a prescribed debt obligation</li>
               <li>shares of controlled corporations in certain circumstances</li>
               </ul>
               <p>There are also special anti-avoidance rules that may apply where a taxpayer has attempted to avoid the application of the limitation rules. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html"><span class="nowrap">Pamphlet P113</span>, Gifts and Income Tax</a>.</p>
               <p>If the property was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter, the eligible amount will be reported in <span class="nowrap">box 13</span> of&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5003.html"><span class="nowrap">T5003 slip</span>, Statement of Tax Shelter Information</a>.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, a capital property is&nbsp;gifted. At the time the property is gifted to a qualified donee, its <a href="#P100_8108">FMV</a> may be more than its&nbsp;<a href="#ACB">ACB</a>.</p>
               <p>When the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> is <strong>more</strong> than the <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr>, you may designate an amount that is <strong>less</strong> than the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> to be the proceeds of disposition. This may allow you to reduce the capital gain otherwise calculated. If you choose to designate an amount that is less than the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> as the amount to be used as the proceeds of disposition, this amount will be used to determine&nbsp;the eligible amount of the donation. You can choose to designate an amount that is <strong>not greater than</strong> the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> and <strong>not less</strong> than the greater of:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>any <a href="#adv001">advantage</a> in respect of the gift</li>
               <li>the <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr> of the property (or, where the property was depreciable property, the lesser of its <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr> and the undepreciated capital cost of the class of the property), at the time you made the donation</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Treat the amount you choose as the proceeds of disposition when you calculate any capital gain.</p>

                     <p>In addition to calculating capital gains, you might need to calculate a Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) when you file a final return if you claimed a Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) in any previous year tax returns on that property.</p>
                     <p>You will need to compare the value of the property you claimed CCA for in previous tax years with the value of the property upon at the date of death.</p>
                     <p>This might result in either:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>recaptured CCA</strong> amount that goes on Line 9947 that you must repay the CRA, if the value of the property did not depreciate as much as you claimed for</li>

                     <p>A record should be kept of the years for which the deceased individual would have been eligible to make a principal residence designation for the particular property.</p>

                  <p>When you sell personal-use property, such as cars and boats, in most cases you do not end up with a capital gain. This is because this type of property usually does not increase in value over the years. As a result, you may end up with a loss.

               <h2 id="h-4">Net capital losses on the final return</h2>
               <p>If the deceased has a net capital loss on line 19900 of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s3.html">Schedule 3</a>, you can apply them to reduce other income with two different methods on the final return.</p>

               <h3>Method A: </h3>

               <h2 id="h-5">Reserves in the year of death</h2>
               <p>You can have reserves both on capital gains as well as <a href="employment-income.html#h-2">self-employment income</a>. You can generally see amounts of reserves claimed in prior years by reviewing prior year Notices of Assessment. This can be done in Represent a Client.</p>
               <h3>What is a reserve</h3>
               <p>When property is sold, sometimes some of the proceeds are not payable until after the year of sale. Usually, a person can deduct from income the part of the proceeds that are not payable until a later year. This is called a reserve.</p>
               <h3 id="reserve-into-income">Reserves claimed in year prior to death</h3>
               <p>Reserves claimed in the year prior to the deceased's death must be included in income on the final return, unless a joint election is filed on Form T2069.</p>
               <p>Complete Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2017.html">T2017 Summary of Reserves on Dispositions of Capital Property</a> (even if it's for a reserve on self-employment income)</p>
               <p>You will have to enter zero for the current yera amount of reserve for dispositions on lines 66840 or 66844 (section A), line 66850 (section B), line 66920 (section C) and line 66990 (section D), unless a reserve is being claimed in the year of death with the joint election in form T2069.</p>
               <h3 id="reserve-election">Eligible reserves in year of death</h3>
               <p>In the final tax return, you will not usually be able to deduct income from the reserve (amounts from a sale that will only be received in a future tax year).</p>
               <p>However, there is an exception where you may claim the reserve in the final return. This is the case if a transfer to a spouse or common-law partner, or spousal or common-law partner trust, of the right to receive the proceeds of disposition or the income owing. When this happens, the legal representative and the beneficiary can choose to claim a reserve on the deceased's return.</p>
               <p>To do this, you must meet the following conditions</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the deceased was a resident of Canada on the date of death</li>
                  <li>the right to receive the proceeds of disposition or the income owing is transferred to the deceased's spouse or common-law partner, or to a spousal or common-law partner trust</li>
                  <li>if a transfer to a spouse or common-law partner, that person also has to have been a resident of Canada right before the deceased's death</li>
                  <li>if a transfer to a spousal or common-law partner trust, the trust has to be resident in Canada right after the proceeds or income become locked-in for the trust</li>
               </ul>

               <p>If any property, investments or belongings are sold <strong>after the date of death</strong>, including the principal residence, before being passed onto a beneficiary, you must report the capital gain in line 1 of a T3 Trust Tax and Information Return for the estate.</p>
               <p>The capital gain on the sale generally is the difference between the sale price and the fair market value (plus costs related to the disposition, if any) that you reported for the property, on the final return.</p>

               <h3 id="h-6a">Capital losses in the T3 can be carried back to the final return</h3>
  
               <p>If you dispose of capital property, the result may be a net capital loss. If you dispose of depreciable property, the result may be a terminal loss.</p>
               <p>Usually, you would claim these losses on the trust's T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return. However, in the&nbsp;first tax year of a deceased person's graduated rate estate, you can&nbsp;elect to&nbsp;treat all or part of these losses as losses of the deceased on the deceased's final return.</p>
               <p>A net capital loss realized in this first tax year cannot be applied to any tax year before the year of death. For more information, refer to "164(6) election" in Chapter 3 of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4013.html">T4013, T3 Trust Guide</a>.</p>
               <p>When filing the amended T1 final return of the deceased, you must clearly identify at the top of the return that you are amending it as a 164(6) election or a 164(6.1) election.</p>
