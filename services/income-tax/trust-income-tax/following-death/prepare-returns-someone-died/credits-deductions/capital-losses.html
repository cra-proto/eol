               <h2 id="h-1">Gather all eligible capital losses for the final return</h2>
               <p>In addition to capital losses from January 1 to the date of death, other capital losses can also be included in the final return for someone who died if they were unclaimed in previous tax years or you make an election in the first T3 of a GRE.</p>

               <h3 id="h-1a">Net capital losses from the final year</h3>
               <p>Refer to <a href="../report-assets/belongings-property.html">Capital gains on belongings, investments, and property</a> to calculate capital gains for the final return.</p>
               <p>If you calculate a loss on line 19900 of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s3.html">Schedule 3</a>, it can be applied to other types of income in the final return.</p>

               <h3 id="h-1b">Unclaimed capital losses from previous tax years</h3>
               <p>If the deceased has unclaimed capital losses from previous tax years, they can usually be seen in Represent a Client under "Carryover amounts" in the Tax returns section.</p>
               
               <h3 id="h-1c">Carry back capital losses from the first year of a GRE</h3>
               <p>If you have not yet filed the final return, skip this section. The legal representative will need to amend the final return after filing the T3 return for the estate.</p>
               <p>If the estate disposes of capital property, the result may be a net capital loss on a T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return. Additionally, if the estate disposes of depreciable property, the result may be a terminal loss on the T3.</p>
               <p>In the&nbsp;first tax year of a deceased person's graduated rate estate, the legal representative can&nbsp;elect to&nbsp;treat all or part of these losses as losses of the deceased on the deceased's final return.</p>
               <p>A net capital loss realized in this first tax year cannot be applied to any tax year before the year of death. For more information, refer to "164(6) election" in Chapter 3 of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4013.html">T4013, T3 Trust Guide</a>.</p>
               <p>When filing the amended T1 final return of the deceased, you must clearly identify at the top of the return that you are amending it as a 164(6) election or a 164(6.1) election.</p>

               <h2 id="h-2">Apply capital losses against capital gains in the final return</h2>
               <p>If there is a capital gain on line 12700 of the final return (or the return for the previous year), you must first apply capital gains against this capital loss.</p>
               <p>If you are applying a loss carried back from the T3, you can subtract it directly on the line 12700 amount. There is no need to adjust it or report it on a separate line.</p>

               <h3>Adjust unclaimed losses from previous tax years</h3>
               <p>To apply an unclaimed capital loss from a previous tax year, you must first:</p>
               <ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">
                  <li>Adjust the unclaimed capital loss by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-12700-capital-gains/you-calculate-your-capital-gain-loss/inclusion-rates-previous-years.html">inclusion rate</a> for the year in which it was incurred.

                  </li>
                  <li>Apply adjusted capital losses on line 25300 up to the full amount of capital gains reported on line 12700.</li>
                  <li>If there are remaining unclaimed losses, readjust the remainder back to before you applied the inclusion rate.
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example, if the remaining capital loss was multiplied by the inclusion rate of 1/2, reverse that by multiplying it by 2. If it was 3/4, then multiply it by 4/3.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ol>

               <p>Unlike in other tax years, remaining capital losses in the final return and the return for the year before the final year can be applied to other forms of income.</p>

               you can you can apply that loss to reduce other income with two different methods on the final return
               <h3>Method A: </h3>


               Line 25300 – Net capital losses of other years – In the explanation area
               The losses of other years can be carried back three years and can be applied against capital gains in the year of the death. These losses, minus the total capital gains deduction allowed in all years can be applied against “income for losses” in the year of death or the immediately preceding year. Example:
               Capital gain in the year of death = $200; Income for losses (taxable income +capital losses claimed on the return and the amount claimed at field 25300) = $25,000;
               Capital losses of other years = $32,000; Capital gains deduction in all years = $4,000
                  a. Allowable at line 25300 to apply against capital gains = $200;
                  b. Maximum allowable at line 25300 to apply against income for losses on the 70(1) return $32,000 - $200 - $4,000 = 27,800;
                  c. Total allowable amount for line 25300 on the 70(1) return = $200 (capital gain) + $25,000 (lesser of income for losses and amount that can be applied) = $25,200.
