               <h4 id="h-1b">Final return 70(1)</h3>
               <p>As the representative of someone who died, you will need to file a final T1 Income Tax and Benefit return for the person who died. This return is referred to the final return 70(1).</p>
                <p>The final return 70(1) reports any income and increases in value of belongings and property up until the date of death and is filed for every person who dies.</p>
               <h4 id="h-1c">Optional returns</h4>
                <p>In additon to the final 70(1), you may choose file optional returns. You are not required to file any of the optional returns, but may do so to reduce or eliminate tax that you would otherwise have to pay for the person who died.</p>
               <p>There are also optional returns that you may choose to file:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Return for rights or things 70(2)</li>
                 <li>Return for a partner or proprietor 150(4)</li>
                 <li>Return for a Graduated Rate Estate (GRE) 104(23)(d)</li>
               </ul>


               <h3 id="h-1d">T3 Trust and Income Information return</h3>
               <p>Generally, a T3 return is filed if there is any income received into to the accounts of the person who died, such as investment income or death benefits from an employer. This means it is possible to have to file a final return 70(1) and a T3 return.</p>

               <p>If the estate continues beyond the year of death, you will need to continue filing a T3 return for estate income in subsequent years.</p>
               <details>
                  <summary>If the estate will continue beyond the year of death</summary>
                  <p>After someone has died, their belongings, property, assets and liabilities become an estate, generally a Graduated Rate Estate (GRE) which may continue to earn income. This is reported by a representative on a T3 Trust Income and Information return, for subsequent years after the death, until the estate is fully distributed to beneficiaries.</p>

                  <p>A Graduated Rate Estate is an estate that arose on and as a consequence of an individual’s death, if that time is no more than 36 months after the death of the individual, and the estate is at that time a testamentary trust that meets all of the following conditions:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The estate designates itself as the deceased individual's GRE in its T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return (T3 Return) for its first taxation year.</li>
                     <li>No other estate designates itself as the GRE of the deceased individual.</li>
                     <li>The estate must include the deceased individual’s social insurance number in its T3 return of income for each taxation year of the estate that ends after 2015 during the 36-month period after the death of the individual.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="h3">Benefits of a Graduated Rate Estate</p>
                  <p>A Graduated Rate Estate has the following benefits:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Income earned by a GRE is taxed at the same <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html#federal">graduated tax rates as individual taxpayers</a></li>
                     <li>Tax credits resulting from <a href="file:///Users/ligustrina/Documents%20(unshared)/GitHub/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/prepare-returns-someone-died/credits-deductions/charitable-donations.html#h-2">charitable donations made from a GRE after the death or in the will</a> can be carried back to previous GRE tax years or to the final return</li>
                  </ol>
               </p>
               </details>
               <!-- <h3 id="h-1a">Apply for a T3 number</h3>
               <p>The legal representative or the authorized representative of the estate can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/application-trust-account-number-overview.html">apply for a T3 number</a> before filing the first T3.</p> -->
               <p>You might not need to file a T3 return if the only income after death can be reported by a beneficiary. For example, the <a href="report-assets/death-benefits.html">CPP/QPP Death Benefit can be reported on the beneficiary's return</a> instead of a T3.</p>



               <h2 id="h-3">Income eligible to report on an optional return</h2>

              <p>If you choose to file any of the optional returns, report all income that is eligible to be included in that optional return in the optional return instead of the final return.</p>

               <p>The difference is that you can <strong>only</strong> report income from specific sources and time periods in the optional returns. </p>
               <p>They are as follows:</p>
               <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                  <dt>Return for rights or things 70(2)</dt>
                  <dd>
                     <p>You can only report income that was received <strong>after death</strong> that, had the person not died, would have been included in their usual income tax return. This does not include capital gains.</p>
