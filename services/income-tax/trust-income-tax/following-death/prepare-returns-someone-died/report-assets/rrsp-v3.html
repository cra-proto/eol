                <p>You may need to contact the financial institution or investment broker of the person who died to determine which type of <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> they held.</p>

	               <p>If the qualifying survivor is 71 in the year the refund of premiums is received, the transfer to an <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> must be completed by December 31 of that year.</p>

                  <p>The issuer who receives the transferred funds will issue a receipt to the qualifying survivor. The qualifying survivor can use the receipt to claim a deduction on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return for the year the refund of premiums was received.</p>
