		<p>Any payments of amounts earned above the fair market value (FMV) from the deceased holder's TFSA, and made out to a non-resident beneficiary or non-resident survivor during the exempt period, are reported on an <b>NR4 slip</b>, ‘Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada, and are subject to non-resident withholding tax.</p>

<h3>Successor holder</h3>	
<p>If the spouse or common-law partner (survivor) is named beneficiary, they will become the successor holder of the TFSA when the original holder dies.</p>
	<p>In this case, the TFSA is <b>rolled over</b> and can continue to exist. Its value, both at the date of the original holder’s death and any income earned after that date, have <b>no tax implications</b> and <b>does not need to be reported</b>.</p> 
	 <p>This applies for all 3 types of TFSA accounts: deposit, annuity contract, and trust arrangement. </p>	    
<p>If the successor holder already has their own TFSA, they would be considered the holder of 2 separate accounts if they choose not to consolidate them. When the successor holder has ownership, they can make tax free withdrawals and new contributions, depending on their own unused TFSA contribution room. They could also transfer part of the value from one account to the other (a qualifying transfer) and it would not affect available TFSA contribution room. </p>
<p>A survivor may also designate a successor holder.</p>		    
		    
		    
		    
		    
		    
		    
		    
		    
<ul class="list-unstyled">
 <li>
  <details>
	  <summary><b>If the TFSA holds more than the allowed contribution room</b></summary>
		<p>If at the time of death, there is an excess TFSA amount in the deceased holder's TFSA, a tax of 1% per-month applies on the highest excess amount, for each month in which the excess stays in the TFSA, up to and including the month of death.</p>
		<p>In these cases the legal representative must file 2 forms:</p>
	<ul>	
	  <li><mark>Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account TFSA) Return</mark></li>
		<li><mark>Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts</mark></li>
	  </ul>
		<p></p>
		
	<p>Also the successor holder is deemed to have made, at the beginning of the month following the date of death, a contribution to their TFSA that’s equal to the amount by which the excess TFSA amount is more than the total FMV, at the date of the holder's death, of all property under any arrangements that ceased to be a TFSA because of the holder's death.</p>
	<p>If that contribution creates an excess TFSA amount in the successor holder's TFSA, they will be subject to the tax of 1% per-month on the highest amount for each month they have an excess contribution.</p>

   <summary>Example scenario</summary>
   <p>Miriam and Pauline were a married couple. Each had available TFSA contribution room of $6,000 at the beginning of 2021. Miriam initially contributed $6,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline contributed $1,500 to hers. On June 12, 2021, Miriam contributed an additional $2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her total contributions for 2021 to $8,000.</p>
  <p>As Miriam only had contribution room of $6,000 for 2021, she had an excess TFSA amount of $2,000. Miriam passed away on September 18, 2021, and the value of her TFSA on that date was $8,000. Miriam had named Pauline as the successor holder of her TFSA if she dies. As Pauline meets all the conditions to be considered a successor holder, she becomes the holder of the TFSA from September 18, 2021.</p>
	 <p>Since an excess TFSA amount remained in Miriam's TFSA at the time of her death, Pauline is deemed to have made, as of October 1, 2021, a $2,000 contribution to her TFSA (which is the excess amount in Miriam's TFSA). As Pauline had only previously contributed $1,500 to her own TFSA, she still had unused TFSA contribution room for 2021 of $4,500. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution does not create an excess TFSA amount in her account.</p>
	<p>Therefore, there are no tax consequences to Pauline based on this deemed contribution. Her unused contribution room for the rest of 2021 is $2,500. However, the legal representative of Miriam's estate must file Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts, for the 2021 tax year reporting the excess in Miriam's TFSA for the period from June up to and including September 2021.</p>

	 <h3>Designated beneficiaries</h3>		
  <p>If designated as a beneficiary, you will not have to pay tax on payments made out of the TFSA account, as long as the total payments do not exceed the fair market value (FMV) of the amount held at the time of the holder’s death.</p>
		    <p>Beneficiaries can contribute any of the amounts they receive to their own TFSA as long as they have unused TFSA contribution room available.</p>

	  <summary><b>If the TFSA account is a deposit or annuity contract</b></summary>
   <p>After the original holder’s date of death, the deposit or annuity contract is considered to be a separate contract and no longer exists as a TFSA.</p> 
	   <p>The holder is considered to have disposed of the contract or the deposit immediately before the time that the TFSA ceased to exist, for an amount equal to the FMV of all the property held in the TFSA at the time of death. All <b>earnings that grow after the holder's death</b> will be taxable to the beneficiary and has to be <b>reported by them as income</b>.</p>
  <p>The normal rules apply for reporting income or gains accrued after the date of death, depending on the specific characteristics of the deposit or annuity contract. For example, <b>interest earned</b> would be <b>reported</b> on a <mark>T5, Statement of Investment Income</mark>.</p>

	  <summary><b>If the TFSA account is an arrangement in trust</b></summary>
   <p>After the original holder’s date of death, the trust continues and remains non-taxable until the end of the exempt period.</p>
  <p>Any amount up to the fair market value (FMV) of the deceased holder’s TFSA on date of death can be paid to beneficiaries without them having to report any amount as income. Any amount paid to beneficiaries that represents an increase in the FMV after the date of death, is taxable to the beneficiaries and has to be <b>reported by them as income</b>. These payments will appear in <b>box 134</b> of a <b>T4A slip</b>.</p>
<p>The trust has the exempt period to distribute both the taxable and non-taxable amounts. The trustee will designate the part of each payment that represents non-taxable FMV at the date of death, with the remaining being taxable. The exempt period is considered to start the day after the original holder’s death and goes until December 31 of the year following the death.</p>
<p>If the trust continues to exist beyond the end of the exempt period, it will be taxable on any undistributed income and must file yearly, a <mark>T3RET, T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return</mark>. The trust will also be required to prepare a <mark>T3, Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations</mark>, in that year or later years, for any distributions of taxable amounts to beneficiaries.</p>

   <summary>Example scenario</summary>
   <p>Martin's mother, who lived in a province that recognizes a TFSA beneficiary designation, passed away on January 9, 2021. The value of her TFSA on that date was $11,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in her account. In her TFSA contract, she had named Martin as the sole beneficiary. Her estate was settled on June 7, 2021. By that time, $200 in additional income had been earned and the full amount of $11,200 was paid to Martin.</p>
  <p>The value of Martin's late mother's TFSA as of the date of her death — $11,000, is not taxable. The income earned after the date of her death, $200, is taxable to Martin. He will receive a T4A slip showing this amount in box 134 "Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount" in the "Other information" section. Martin can contribute any of the amounts he receives to his own TFSA as long as he has unused TFSA contribution room available.</p>

		 <h3>Qualified donee</h3>	 
	<p>If a qualified donee (registered charities, municipalities, etc), is named as a beneficiary, the transfer of funds must generally occur within the 36-month period following the holder’s death.</p>
		    <p>Once the donation has been completed, it is possible to have the deceased’s final return reassessed, to be able to claim the charitable donation tax credit. </p>
