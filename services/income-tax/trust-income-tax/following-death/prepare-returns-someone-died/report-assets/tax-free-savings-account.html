               <p> In general, you do not need to report <abbr title="Tax Free Savings Account">TFSA</abbr> amounts as income on the final return or any optional returns.</p>
               <p>Any reporting and tax implications will depend on the deceased’s type of TFSA, the type of beneficiaries, and if any income was earned after the date of death.</p>  
                 <p>You may need to contact the financial institution or investment broker of the person who died to determine which type of TFSA they held.</p>

               <p>Depending on who receives the TFSA after the death, there will be different tax implications. Determine the type of beneficiary based on the following:<p>
		    <ul>
			    <li>a beneficiary designated in the deceased holder's TFSA contract</li>
			    <li>the terms of the deceased holder's will (if there was one)</li>
			    <li>provincial or territorial succession legislation</li>
		    </ul>
		 <p>The types of beneficiaries for TFSA's are:</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li>a spouse or common-law partner (survivor) who has been designated as a <a href="#h-2a">successor holder</a></li>
			 <li><a href="#h-2b">designated beneficiaries</a>, who can include:</li>
			 <ul>
				 <li>a survivor who has not been named as successor holder</li>
				 <li>former spouses or common-law partners</li>
				 <li>children</li>
				 <li>a designated subsequent survivor holder who is the new spouse or common-law partner of the successor holder, and</li>

			      <p>The issuer will notify us of this change in ownership.</p>
               <p>When the successor holder has ownership, they can make tax free withdrawals and new contributions, depending on their own unused TFSA contribution room.</p> 
			      <p>If the successor holder already has their own TFSA, they would be considered the holder of 2 separate accounts if they choose not to consolidate them.

                  <p>If at the time of death, there is an excess TFSA amount in the deceased holder's TFSA:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>up to and including the month of death, a tax of 1% per-month applies on the excess amount, for each month in which the excess stays in the TFSA</li>
                     <li>at the beginning of the month following the date of death, the successor holder is deemed to have made a contribution to their own TFSA that’s equal to the excess TFSA amount
                        <ul>
                           <li>If that contribution creates an excess TFSA amount in the successor holder's TFSA, they will be subject to the tax of 1% per-month on the excess amount, for each month in which the excess stays in the TFSA</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>If the excess amount changes during a month, the 1% tax will be applied to the highest value the excess reached during that month.</p>
                  <p>In these cases the legal representative must file 2 forms:</p>

                           <p>Miriam and Pauline were a married couple. Each had available TFSA contribution room of $6,000 at the beginning of 2021. Miriam initially contributed $6,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline contributed $1,500 to hers. On June 12, 2021, Miriam contributed an additional $2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her total contributions for 2021 to $8,000.</p>
                           <p>As Miriam only had contribution room of $6,000 for 2021, she had an excess TFSA amount of $2,000. Miriam passed away on September 18, 2021, and the value of her TFSA on that date was $8,000. Miriam had named Pauline as the successor holder of her TFSA if she dies. As Pauline meets all the conditions to be considered a successor holder, she becomes the holder of the TFSA from September 18, 2021.</p>
                           <p>Since an excess TFSA amount remained in Miriam's TFSA at the time of her death, Pauline is deemed to have made, as of October 1, 2021, a $2,000 contribution to her TFSA (which is the excess amount in Miriam's TFSA). As Pauline had only previously contributed $1,500 to her own TFSA, she still had unused TFSA contribution room for 2021 of $4,500. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution does not create an excess TFSA amount in her account.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, there are no tax consequences to Pauline based on this deemed contribution. Her unused contribution room for the rest of 2021 is $2,500. However, the legal representative of Miriam's estate must file Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts, for the 2021 tax year reporting the excess in Miriam's TFSA for the period from June up to and including September 2021.</p>

			 <p>In certain cases, a survivor, designated as the successor holder of a TFSA, could not have a valid Canadian social insurance number (SIN), which is one of the eligibility requirements for opening a TFSA. If the survivor is a Canadian resident, they should apply to Service Canada to get a valid Canadian SIN.</p>
			 <p>If the survivor is a non-resident, they should ask for an individual tax number from the CRA by filling out Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html">T1261, Application for a Canada Revenue Agency Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents</a>.</p>

		       <h3 id="h-2b">Transfer to a designated beneficiary</h3>
           <p>A designated beneficiary will not have to pay tax on payments made out of the TFSA, as long as the total payments do not exceed the fair market value of all the property held in the TFSA at the time of the holder's death.</p>
	   <p>Specific rules depend on whether the TFSA is a deposit or annuity contract, or if it is a trust arrangement.</p>
	   <details>
		   <summary>If the TFSA account is a <strong>deposit</strong> or <strong>annuity contract</strong></summary>
		   <p>After the holder's death, the deposit or annuity contract is considered to be a separate contract and is no longer considered as a TFSA. The holder is considered to have disposed of the contract or the deposit immediately before the time that the TFSA ceased to exist for an amount equal to the fair market value of all the property held in the TFSA at the time of death.</p>
		   <p>The fair market value of the TFSA at the time of death is not taxable. However, all earnings that grow after the holder's death will be taxable to the beneficiary and have to be reported by them as income.</p>

                           <p>If the trust continues to exist beyond the end of the exempt period (for example, not all amounts from the deceased's TFSA have been paid to beneficiaries), it will be taxable from that point forward.</p>
			 <p>It becomes a taxable <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/types-trusts.html#tfsa">inter vivos trust</a> with a tax year beginning January 1 of the following calendar year. The trust will be treated as having disposed of and immediately reacquired its property for its fair market value at that time.</p> 
			 <p>For as long as it continues to exist, the trust would itself be taxable on any undistributed income (including, for its first tax year, any undistributed income or gains during the exempt period) and required to annually file a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3RET, T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return</a>. The trust will also be required to prepare a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3.html">T3, Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations</a> in that year or later years for any distributions of taxable amounts to beneficiaries.</p>
                       
                     </li>
                  </ul>
   <h3>Survivors and beneficiaries not living in Canada</h3>
               <p>Any payments of amounts earned above the fair market value from the deceased holder's TFSA, and made out to a non-resident beneficiary or non-resident survivor during the exempt period, are reported on an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr4.html"> NR4 Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada</a>, and are subject to non-resident withholding tax.</p>
<h3>Management fees</h3>
<p>Management fees related to a TFSA trust and paid by the holder are not considered to be contributions to the TFSA. The payment of investment counsel, transfer, or other fees by a TFSA trust will not result in a distribution (withdrawal) from the TFSA trust.</p>
               </details>

<h3>Contributions to beneficiary TFSAs</h3>
<p>Beneficiaries may contribute the amounts they receive to their own TFSA as long as they have the unused TFSA contribution room available. In this case, it would no longer be taxable as a part of their own TFSA.</p>
<p>If designated as a beneficiary, the spouse or common-law partner (survivor) has the option to contribute and designate all or a portion of a survivor payment as an exempt contribution to their own TFSA, without affecting their own unused TFSA contribution room.</p>
<details>
	<summary><strong>To designate an exempt contribution</strong></summary>
	<p>For the survivor to designate an exempt contribution:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the amount must be received and contributed to their TFSA during the rollover period, which is the period that begins when the TFSA holder dies, and ends at the end of the calendar year that follows the year of death</li> 
					<li>they must designate their survivor payments on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc240.html">Form RC240, Designation of an Exempt Contribution Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)</a>, and send the designation within 30 days after the day the contribution is made or at a later time as permitted by the Minister of National Revenue</li>
					</li>
				</ul>
	      <p>The total exempt contributions designated during the rollover period cannot exceed the fair market value of the deceased holder's TFSA at the time of death.</p>
	      <p>No amount of the survivor payment can be designated as an exempt contribution if:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>the TFSA of the deceased holder includes an excess TFSA amount at the time of death</li>
		      <li>payments are being received by more than one survivor</li>
		      <li>the survivor payment and/or the contribution is made after the rollover period</li>
		      </li>
	      </ul>
	  
	
				<details>
                           <summary>Example of exempt contribution by a survivor</summary>
                           <p>Brian died on February 2, 2021. He was living with his common-law partner, Fred, in Ontario. The value of his trusteed TFSA on that date was $9,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in his account. In Brian's TFSA contract, he had not filled out the part about a successor holder, but he named Fred as the beneficiary. His estate was settled on August 15, 2021. By that time, an additional $150 of income had been earned, and the full amount of $9,150 was paid to Fred.</p>
                           <p>The value of Brian's TFSA as of the date of his death, $9,000, is not taxable. The additional income earned after the date of death, $150, is taxable to Fred. His T4A slip will show an amount in box 134 "Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount" in the "Other information" section.</p>
                           <p>The amount paid to Fred, as the surviving common-law partner, is considered a survivor payment. Since the survivor payment was made during the rollover period, Fred can rollover up to $9,000 (the value of the TFSA as of the date of death) to his own TFSA, as an exempt contribution.</p>
                           <p>An exempt contribution does not affect Fred's unused TFSA contribution room. For the contribution of a survivor payment to be considered an exempt contribution during the rollover period, Fred must designate it on Form RC240, Designation of an Exempt Contribution Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), within 30 days after the contribution is made or at a later time as permitted by the Minister of National Revenue.</p>
                        </details>

</details>
 <p>Beneficiaries other than the survivor, who receive a payment from the deceased holder's TFSA, cannot contribute and designate any amount as an exempt contribution.</p>



<h4>Special circumstances for transfers</h4>  
<details>
   <summary>If the deceased holder made excess contributions to their TFSA</summary> 
   <p>If at the time of death, there is an excess TFSA amount in the deceased holder's TFSA, a tax of 1% per-month applies on the excess amount, for each month in which the excess stays in the TFSA, up to and including the month of death.</p>
   <p>If the excess amount changes during a month, the 1% tax will be applied to the highest value the excess reached during that month.</p>
   <p>In these cases the legal representative must file 2 forms:</p>
   <ul>	
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">RC243 Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243-sch-a.html">RC243-SCH-A Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts</a></li>
   </ul>
</details>
	
	<details>
		<summary>Donation to a qualified donee</summary>
		<p>The Income Tax Act permits qualified donees to issue tax receipts for donations they receive from individuals or corporations.</p>
		<p>Some examples of qualified donees are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>registered charities</li>
			<li>Canadian municipalities</li>
			<li>registered Canadian amateur athletic associations</li> 
<li>the United Nations or one of their agencies</li>
<li>universities outside Canada that accept Canadian students</li>
		</ul>
<p>A qualified donee must transfer the funds within the 36-month period following the holder’s death.</p>
			<p>Once the donation has been completed, it is possible to have the deceased’s final return reassessed, to be able to claim the charitable donation tax credit.</p>
