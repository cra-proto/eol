               <p>To determine how to report the commission income and claim expenses for a self-employed salesperson, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4002.html"><span class="nowrap">Guide T4002</span>, Self-employed, Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income</a>.</p>

               <p><strong>Note:&nbsp;Lines 13499 to 14300 were lines 135 to 143 before tax year 2019.</strong></p>
               <p>If the deceased had self-employment income, report the gross and net income or loss on the appropriate line.</p>
               <p><strong>Reserves in the year of death</strong><br>
               Sometimes, when a property is sold, some of the proceeds are not payable until after the year of sale. Similarly, a self-employed person may have amounts that they will receive in a later year for work done this year. An example is for work in progress.</p>
               <p>Usually, a person can deduct from income the part of the proceeds that are not payable until a later year. This is called a reserve.</p>
               <p>In most cases, you cannot deduct a reserve in the year of death. However, there may be a transfer to a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#spouse">spouse</a> or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#common">common-law partner</a>, or spousal or common-law partner trust, of the right to receive the proceeds of disposition or the income owing. When this happens, the legal representative and the beneficiary can choose to claim a reserve on the deceased's return. To do this, complete <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2069.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T2069</span>, Election in Respect of Amounts Not Deductible as Reserves for the Year of Death</a>, and attach a copy to the deceased's return.</p>
               <p>This choice is available only if the deceased was a resident of Canada right before death. For a transfer to a spouse or common-law partner, that person also has to have been a resident of Canada right before the deceased's death. For a transfer to a spousal or common-law partner trust, the trust has to be resident in Canada right after the proceeds or income become <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#locked">locked-in</a> for the trust.</p>
               <p>The spouse or common-law partner, or spousal or common-law partner trust includes in income an amount equal to the reserve that is on Form T2069. This income has to be included on the return for the first tax year after death. You have to attach a copy of <span class="nowrap">Form T2069 </span>to that return.</p>
