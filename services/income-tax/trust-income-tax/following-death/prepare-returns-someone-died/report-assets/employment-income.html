               <!-- <p>You have to follow certain rules when reporting business, farming, fishing, and rental income. The following publications contain more information and the forms you may need to calculate the trust's income:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Guide <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4002.html">T4002, Self-employed Business, Professional&nbsp;Commission, Farming, and Fishing&nbsp;Income</a> (Form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2125.html">T2125, Statement of Business or Professional Activities</a>, Form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2042.html">T2042, Statement of Farming Activities</a>, and Form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2121.html">T2121, Statement of Fishing Activities</a>).</li>

               <h3>Reserves in the year of death</h3>
               <p>In the final tax return, you will not usually be able to deduct income from the reserve (amounts from a sale that will only be received in a future tax year).</p>
               <details>
                  <summary>Learn more about the reserve deduction</summary>
                  <p>A self-employed person may have amounts that they will receive in a later year for work done this year. An example is for work in progress.</p>
                  <p>Usually, a person can deduct from income the part of the proceeds that are not payable until a later year. This is called a reserve.</p>
               </details>
               <p>However, there is an exception where you may claim the reserve in the final return. This is the case if a transfer to a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#spouse">spouse</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#common">common-law partner</a>, or spousal or common-law partner trust, of the right to receive the proceeds of disposition or the income owing. When this happens, the legal representative and the beneficiary can choose to claim a reserve on the deceased's return. To do this, complete <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2069.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T2069</span>, Election in Respect of Amounts Not Deductible as Reserves for the Year of Death</a>, and attach a copy to the deceased's return.</p>
               <p>This choice is available only if the deceased was a resident of Canada right before death. For a transfer to a spouse or common-law partner, that person also has to have been a resident of Canada right before the deceased's death. For a transfer to a spousal or common-law partner trust, the trust has to be resident in Canada right after the proceeds or income become <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#locked">locked-in</a> for the trust.</p>
               <p>The spouse or common-law partner, or spousal or common-law partner trust includes in income an amount equal to the reserve that is on Form T2069. This income has to be included on the return for the first tax year after death. You have to attach a copy of <span class="nowrap">Form T2069 </span>to that return.</p>
