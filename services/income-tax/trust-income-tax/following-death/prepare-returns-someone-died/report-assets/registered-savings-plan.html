	  <summary>Example scenario</summary>
	  <p>Martin died in June 2019 at the age of 67. When he died the FMV of his unmatured trusteed RRSP was $185,000. The FMV of the RRSP on December 31, 2020, was $215,000. On June 30, 2021, the day the RRSP property was distributed, the FMV of the RRSP was $225,000.</p>
	  <p>The RRSP contract designated Martin's spouse, Elaine, as the sole beneficiary. Elaine, who is also the legal representative of Martin's estate, received the following two slips from the RRSP issuer:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>a T4RSP slip for 2021 issued in her name, showing $30,000 in box 18, and $10,000 in boxes 28 and 40</li>
		  <li>a T4RSP slip for 2019 in Martin's name, showing $185,000 in box 34. Although Elaine is the sole beneficiary, the slip was issued to Martin because the conditions were not met.</p>
	  </ul>
		  <p>Elaine wants to know if it would be beneficial to ask for a reduction to the amount that we consider Martin received from his RRSP when he died. She fills out Chart 2, and determines that she can claim a reduction of $185,000. She reviews Martin's tax situation and her own, and decides to claim a $100,000 reduction. This reduces the amount reported on line 12900 of Martin's 2019 income tax and benefit return to $85,000 ($185,000 – $100,000), and increases the amount reported on line 12900 of Elaine's 2021 income tax and benefit return to $140,000 ($100,000 + $30,000 + $10,000).</p>
		  <p>Because the FMV of the RRSP at the time of death was included in Martin's income for 2019, Elaine has to write a letter to ask for an adjustment to that year's income tax and benefit return. To minimize her 2021 taxes, she transfers $130,000 to her RRIF. This is the difference between the amount she included in income ($140,000) and the amount shown in boxes 28 and 40 of her T4RSP slip ($10,000). Elaine claims a $130,000 deduction on line 23200 of her 2021 income tax and benefit return.</p>
