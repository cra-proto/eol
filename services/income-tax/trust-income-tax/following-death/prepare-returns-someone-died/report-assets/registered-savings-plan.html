  <h5>Eligibility for a full transfer to a spouse or common-law partner</h5>
  <p>To be eligible to defer tax implications of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> by fully transferring it to the spouse or common-law partner, 2 conditions must be met:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The spouse or common-law partner is named as <strong>sole</strong> beneficiary of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> contract or the will</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The entire <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> property is directly transferred, by December 31 of the year following the year of death, to either:
      <ul>
        <li>the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Pooled Registered Pension Plan">PRPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Specified Pension Plan">SPP</abbr>, or <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> in which the spouse or common-law partner is the annuitant</li>
        <li>an issuer to buy an eligible annuity for the spouse or common-law partner</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the full amount is not transferred solely to the spouse or common-law partner, or if the transfer doesn't happen by December 31 of the year following the death, the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> will be <a href="#qualifying-survivors">transferred to the spouse as a qualifying survivor</a> instead.</p>

  <h5>Transfer is not limited by the usual <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit</h5>
  <p>The transfer to the spouse or common-law partner's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> is exempt from their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit.</p>
  <p>When filing their T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return, the spouse or common-law partner should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>complete Part C of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s7.html">Schedule 7, RRSP, PRPP, and SPP Unused Contributions, Transfers, and HBP or LLP Activities</a></li>
    <li>claim the transfer on line 15 to ensure that the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit is not reduced by this amount</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Report the full transfer</h5>
  <dl class="dl-horizontal mrgn-lft-md">
    <dt>Found on slip</dt>
    <dd>T4RSP - box 18 (issued to the spouse or common-law partner)</dd>
    <dt>Report on line</dt>

  </dl>
  <p>If the full amount is transferred to the spouse or common-law partner, the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> is <strong>not</strong> reported on the deceased annuitant's Final Return 70(1).</p>
  <p>The spouse or common-law partner must report the amount transferred as income on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return, and may be able to claim a deduction for this amount.</p>
  
  <h5>Claim the deduction</h5>
  <!-- <p>Claim the amount from box 18 as a deduction on <strong>line 20800</strong>.</p> -->
  <p>The spouse or common-law partner will claim the deduction on the amount transferred on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>line 20800</strong> if transferred to their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Pooled Registered Pension Plan">PRPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Specified Pension Plan">SPP</abbr></li>
        <li><strong>line 23200</strong> if transferred to their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> or used to purchase an annuity</li>

  <h5>Change in value after the date of death</h5>
  <p>If there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> between the date of death and the transfer, it will be included in box 18. The spouse or common-law partner reports this on line 12900 and claims the deduction on line 20800 or 23200 if applicable.</p>
  <p>If there is a <strong>decrease</strong> in the value of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> between the date of death and the transfer, it will not affect the box 18 amount. Instead, the legal representative may <a href="#decrease-deduc">claim a line 23200 deduction on the decrease in value</a>.</p>
  <!-- <p>This amount has to be included in the income of the beneficiary or the estate for the year it is received.  -->

<details>
  <summary>One or more qualifying survivors <small>(such as a spouse or grandchild)</small></summary>
  
  <h5 id="qualifying-survivors">Who is considered a qualifying survivor</h5>
  <p>A deceased annuitant's spouse or common-law partner or financially-dependent children or grandchildren are considered <strong>qualifying survivors</strong>.</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Which children qualify as <strong>financially dependent</strong></summary>
    <p>A child or grandchild of an annuitant, where before the annuitant's death, were living with them <strong>and</strong> met <strong>1</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>net income for the previous year (line 23600 of income tax return) was less than the basic personal amount (line 30000 of income tax return) for that previous year</li>
      <li>financial dependence is due to a mental or physical infirmity and your net income for the previous year was equal to or less than the basic personal amount, <strong>plus</strong> the disability amount (line 31600 of income tax return) for that previous year</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <h5>Transfer is not limited by usual <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit</h5>
  <p>Amounts transferred from a deceased annuitant's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> to qualifying survivors are not subject to the qualifying survivor's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limits if the transfers:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>were made to the qualifying survivors' <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Pooled Registered Pension Plan">PRPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Specified Pension Plan">SPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> or used to buy them an annuity</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>do not exceed the fair market value of the deceased's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> when the annuitant died plus any income earned in the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> before December 31 of the year following the death</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>were made during the year or within 60 days of the end of the year that the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> was paid out <small>(this is generally only applicable to indirect transfers, such as <a href="#form-t2019">transfers with form T2019</a> or annuity purchases after the transfer date)</small></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, if the transfer is made to the qualifying survivor's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, it must be:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>made before December 31 of the year during which the qualifying survivor turns 71</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Amounts transferred that meet these criteria are a deductible <strong>refund of premiums</strong>.</p>
  <p>If amounts earned in the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> after December 31 of the year following the death were included in a transfer, they might not qualify for the deduction (not considered a refund of premiums). If this is the case, <a href="#contact-bank-rrsp-type">consult your financial institution about amounts that might not qualify</a>.</p>
  <p>When filing their T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return, the qualifying survivor should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>complete Part C of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s7.html">Schedule 7, RRSP, PRPP, and SPP Unused Contributions, Transfers, and HBP or LLP Activities</a></li>
    <li>claim the qualifying transfer on line 15 to ensure that the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit is not reduced by this amount</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If a transfer does <strong>not</strong> meet the above conditions, the qualifying survivor might still choose to move the amounts to their registered plans within their deduction limits and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-20800-rrsp-deduction.html">claim the usual deduction</a>.</p>

  <p>The qualifying survivor must report the amount transferred in full on line 12900 of their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return.</p>

  <h5 id="claim-un">Claim deductions for transfers to qualifying survivors</h5>
  <p>The qualifying survivor will claim the deduction on the refund of premiums (generally, the same as the amount transferred) on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>line 20800</strong> if transferred to their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Pooled Registered Pension Plan">PRPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Specified Pension Plan">SPP</abbr></li>
    <li><strong>line 23200</strong> if transferred to their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> or used to purchase an annuity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Attach the receipt for the transfer of funds issued by the bank or other issuer to the return. This is to ensure the transfer meets the requirements for the deduction.</p>

  <h5>Change in value after the date of death</h5>
  <p>If there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> between the date of death and the transfer, the increase will be included in box 28 or 18. The qualifying survivor reports this on line 12900 and claims the deduction on line 20800 or line 23200 if applicable.</p>
  <p>If there is a <strong>decrease</strong> in the value of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> between the date of death and the transfer, it will not be included in the box 28 or box 18 amount. Instead, the legal representative may <a href="#h-2c">claim a line 23200 deduction on the decrease in value</a>.</p>
