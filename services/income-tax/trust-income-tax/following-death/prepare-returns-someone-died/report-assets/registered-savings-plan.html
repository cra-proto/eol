<p>How a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is treated and reported at the time of the plan holder's (annuitant) death depends on whether it is unmatured or matured and if there was a rollover or transfer to a survivor or beneficiary.</p>

<p>After the annuitant’s death, the RRSP can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner, other qualifying survivors or beneficiaries, or the estate. Income is reported differently depending on how it is transferred.</p>
<!-- <p>Determine how the RRSP is being rolled over or transferred to find out how it should be reported in income taxes.</p> -->
<h4>Determine how the RRSP is being transferred</h4>
<p>Who is the unmatured RRSP being transferred to?</p>
<details>
  <summary>The spouse or common-law partner as the <strong>sole</strong> beneficiary</summary>
  
  <h5>Eligibility for special treatment for a full transfer to a spouse or common-law partner</h5>
  <p>If the full amount is transferred to the spouse or common-law partner, the RRSP is <strong>not</strong> reported on the deceased annuitant's final return 70(1).</p>
  <p>To be eligible, 2 conditions must be met:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The spouse or common-law partner is named as <strong>sole</strong> beneficiary of the RRSP contract or the will</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The entire RRSP property is directly transferred, by December 31 of the year following the year of death, to either:
      <ul>
        <li>the RRSP, PRPP, SPP, or RRIF in which the spouse or common-law partner is the annuitant</li>
        <li>an issuer to buy an eligible annuity for the spouse or common-law partner</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the full amount is not transferred solely to the spouse or common-law partner, or if the transfer doesn't happen by December 31 of the year following the death, the RRSP will be <a href="#qualifying-survivors">transferred to the spouse as a qualifying survivor</a> instead.</p>

  <h5>Transfer is not limited by the usual RRSP contribution limit</h5>
  <p>The transfer to the spouse or common-law partner's RRSP is exempt from their RRSP contribution limit.</p>
  <p>When filing their T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return, the spouse or common-law partner should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>complete Part C of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s7.html">Schedule 7, RRSP, PRPP, and SPP Unused Contributions, Transfers, and HBP or LLP Activities</a></li>
    <li>claim the transfer on line 15 to ensure that the RRSP deduction limit is not reduced by this amount</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Report the full transfer</h5>
  <dl class="dl-horizontal mrgn-lft-md">

  </dl>
  <p>The RRSP of the deceased is <strong>not</strong> reported on the deceased annuitant's final return 70(1).</p>
  <p>The spouse or common-law partner must report the amount transferred as income on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return, and may be able to <a href="#claim-un">claim a deduction</a> for this amount.</p>
  
  <h5>Claim the deduction</h5>
  <p>Claim the amount from box 18 as a deduction on <strong>line 20800</strong>.</p>
  <!-- <h4 id="claim-un">Claim the deduction for amounts if rolled over or transferred</h4> -->
  <!-- <p><a href="#claim-un">Claim the deduction for rollover to a spouse or common-law partner</a></p> -->

  <h5>Change in value after the date of death</h5>
  <p>If there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of the RRSP between the date of death and the transfer, it will be included in the box 18 amount that the spouse or common-law partner reports on line 12900 and 20800.</p>
  <p>If there is a <strong>decrease</strong> in the value of the RRSP between the date of death and the transfer, it will not affect the box 18 amount. Instead, the spouse or common-law partner may <a href="#decrease-deduc">claim a line 23200 deduction on the decease in value</a>.</p>
  <!-- <p>This amount has to be included in the income of the beneficiary or the estate for the year it is received.  -->

  <summary>One or more qualifying survivors <small>(such as a spouse or grandchild)</small></summary>
  
  <h5 id="qualifying-survivors">Who is considered a qualifying survivor</h5>
  <p>A deceased annuitant's spouse or common-law partner or financially-dependent children or grandchildren are considered <strong>qualifying survivors</strong>.</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Which children qualify as <strong>financially dependent</strong></summary>
    <p>A child or grandchild of an annuitant, where before the annuitant's death, were living with them <strong>and</strong> met <strong>1</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>net income for the previous year (line 23600 of income tax return) was less than the basic personal amount (line 30000 of income tax return) for that previous year</li>
      <li>financial dependence is due to a mental or physical infirmity and your net income for the previous year was equal to or less than the basic personal amount, <strong>plus</strong> the disability amount (line 31600 of income tax return) for that previous year</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <h5>Transfer is not limited by usual RRSP contribution limit</h5>
  <p>The transfer to a qualifying survivor's RRSP is exempt from their RRSP contribution limit.</p>
  <p>When filing their T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return, the qualifying survivor should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>complete Part C of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s7.html">Schedule 7, RRSP, PRPP, and SPP Unused Contributions, Transfers, and HBP or LLP Activities</a></li>

  <p>You may <strong>reduce the amount of income</strong> that is reported on the deceased's final return 70(1) if amounts from the RRSP are transferred to the registered plans of qualifying survivors.</p>
  <!-- <p>A rollover can only be made to a beneficiary who was either the spouse or common-law partner of the annuitant or a financially dependent child or grandchild of the annuitant on the date of death.</p> -->

  <p>The qualifying survivor will claim the deduction on the refund of premiums (generally, the same as the amount transferred) on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>line 20800</strong> if transferred to their RRSP, PRPP or SPP</li>
    <li><strong>line 23200</strong> if transferred to their RRIF, RDSP or annuity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Attach the receipt for the transfer of funds issued by the bank or other issuer to the return. This is to ensure the transfer meets the requirements for the deduction.</p>

  <h5>Change in value after the date of death</h5>
  <p>If there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of the RRSP between the date of death and the transfer, the increase will be included in the box 28 or box 18 amount that the qualifying survivor reports on line 12900 and claims on the line 20800 or line 23200 deduction.</p>
  <p>If there is a <strong>decrease</strong> in the value of the RRSP between the date of death and the transfer, it will not be included in the box 28 or box 18 amount. Instead, the qualifying survivor may <a href="#decrease-deduc">claim a line 23200 deduction on the decease in value</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="contact-bank-rrsp-type">If the RRSP is not transferred until after December 31 of the year following the death</h5>
  <p>Income of the RRSP after December 31 of the year following the death is reported differently for different banks and financial institutions. <strong>Ask the financial institution</strong> managing the RRSP if it is a <strong>depositary</strong>, <strong>trusteed</strong> or <strong>insured</strong> RRSP, and refer to the third column in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4177/death-rrsp-annuitant-a-prpp-member.html#chart1">Chart 1 of the RC4177 Death of an RRSP Annuitant</a> about how to report it.</p>

<h4>Claim a deduction for a decrease in value</h4>
<p>Was there a decrease in the value of the RRSP?</p>
<details>
  <summary>Yes - there was a <strong>decrease</strong> in the value</summary>
  <p>Sometimes, the fair market value of the property of an unmatured RRSP <strong>decreases</strong> between the date of death and the date of final distribution to the beneficiary or the estate.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the total of all distributions from the RRSP is less than the fair market value of the property that was included in the deceased annuitant's income for the year of death, the deceased's legal representative can request that the difference be deducted on the deceased's final return through a reassessment.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc249.html">Form RC249 - Post-Death Decline in the Value of a RRIF, an Unmatured RRSP and Post-Death Increase or Decline in the Value of a PRPP</a> can be validated by the RRSP issuer and will allow the executor to claim a deduction on <strong>line 23200</strong>.</li>
    <li>Generally, for the deduction to be allowed, the final distribution must occur by the end of the year that follows the year of death.</li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>No - there was no change in the value</summary>
  <p>If the value of the RRSP did not change between the date of death and distribution to a beneficiary, there are no further amounts to report.</p>
