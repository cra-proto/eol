<p>How a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) is treated and reported at the time of the plan holder's (annuitant) death depends on whether there was a rollover or transfer to a survivor or beneficiary.</p>
   <h2>Report RRIF income and value</h2>
 <h3 id="">Income during the final year</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal mrgn-lft-md">
  <dt>Found on slip</dt>
  <dd>T4RIF - box 18 (issued to the deceased annuitant)</dd>
  <dt>Report on line</dt>
  <dd>13000 of the deceased annuitant's Final return 70(1)</dd>
</dl>
<p>All amounts the annuitant received from the RRSP in the year of death will have to be reported on the annuitant’s final return 70(1). A T4RIF slip is issued in the name of the annuitant for the year of death and will also show any other amounts the annuitant received in the year.</p>
<p>If the deceased was 65 or older, or if the deceased was under 65 and received the RRIF payments due to the death of their spouse or common-law partner, see Line 11500 - Other pensions or superannuation. </p>
			<h3>Value of the RRIF on the date of death and rollovers to a spouse or common-law partner</h3>
	<p>At the time of the annuitant's death, we consider them to have received the fair market value of all property held in their RRIF.</p>   
	<p>You can partially or completely reduce the amount of income that is reported on the RRIF holder's final return 70(1) if amounts from the RRIF are transferred or rolled over to the registered plans of beneficiaries.</p>
	<p>A rollover can only be made to a beneficiary who was either the spouse or common-law partner of the annuitant or a financially dependent child or grandchild of the annuitant on the date of death.</p>
                        

                        <p class="h4">Is the RRIF being rolled over?</p>

</dl>
				<p>If the annuitant's spouse or common-law partner is designated as a successor annuitant to all or part of the RRSP in the RRSP contract or the will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the amount of the RRSP that is rolled over to the successor annuitant will not be reported in the final return of the deceased</li>
    <li>the spouse or common-law partner will begin receiving the remaining annuity payments from the plan and will report those as part of their own income

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>If a successor annuitant is not identified in the RRSP contract:</strong></p>
  <p>If the deceased's will states that the spouse or common-law partner is entitled to the amounts paid under the RRSP, or that the spouse or common-law partner is the sole beneficiary of the estate, that person and the legal representative can jointly elect, in a written letter, to treat the amounts paid to the estate as being paid to the spouse or common-law partner.</p>
  <p>The RRIF carrier must also agree to contine the payments under the deceased annuitant's RRIF to the surviving spouse or common-law partner.</p>
				<ul>
    <li>The written election has to specify that this person is electing to become the annuitant of the RRIF</li>
	<li>Attach a copy of the written election to the income tax return of the surviving spouse or common-law partner</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After the election is made, the spouse or common-law partner will be treated as if they were the beneficiary designated in the RRIF contract.</p>
