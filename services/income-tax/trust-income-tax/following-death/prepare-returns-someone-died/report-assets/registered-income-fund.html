<p>How a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) is treated and reported at the time of the plan holder's (annuitant) death depends on whether there was a rollover or transfer to a survivor or beneficiary.</p>

</dl>
<p>All amounts the annuitant received from the RRIF in the year of death will have to be reported on the annuitant’s Final Return 70(1). A T4RIF slip is issued in the name of the annuitant for the year of death and will also show any other amounts the annuitant received in the year.</p>
	<p>If the deceased was 65 or older, or if the deceased was under 65 and received the RRIF payments due to the death of their spouse or common-law partner, see <a href= "https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/prepare-returns-someone-died/report-assets/pension-income.html#h-3">Line 11500 - Other pensions or superannuation</a>. </p>
	<!-- <p>In addition to income from the RRIF, Box 18 of the T4RIF will also show the <a href="#h-2">value of the RRIF on the date of death</a>.

	<h2 id="h-2">Remaining value of the RRIF on the date of death and transfers</h2>
  <p>After the annuitant’s death, the RRIF can be taken over by a spouse or common-law partner, transferred to other qualifying survivors, or left to other beneficiaries or the estate. The reporting requirements depend on how it is transferred.</p>

      <h4>Eligibility for a full transfer to a spouse or common-law partner</h4>
      <p>To be eligible to defer tax implications of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> by fully transferring it to the spouse or common-law partner, 2 conditions must be met:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The spouse or common-law partner is named as <strong>sole</strong> beneficiary of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> contract</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The entire <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> property is directly transferred, by December 31 of the year following the year of death, to either:
          <ul>
            <li>the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Pooled Registered Pension Plan">PRPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Specified Pension Plan">SPP</abbr>, or <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> in which the spouse or common-law partner is the annuitant</li>
            <li>an issuer to buy an eligible annuity for the spouse or common-law partner</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the full amount is not transferred solely to the spouse or common-law partner, or if the transfer doesn't happen by December 31 of the year following the death, the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> will be <a href="#qualifying-survivors">transferred to the spouse as a qualifying survivor</a> instead.</p>
    
      <h4>Transfer is not limited by the usual <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit</h4>
      <p>The transfer to the spouse or common-law partner's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> or <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> is exempt from their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit.</p>
      <p>When filing their T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return, the spouse or common-law partner should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>complete Part C of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s7.html">Schedule 7, RRSP, PRPP, and SPP Unused Contributions, Transfers, and HBP or LLP Activities</a></li>

      <p>If the full amount is transferred to the spouse or common-law partner, the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> is <strong>not</strong> reported on the deceased annuitant's Final Return 70(1).</p>
      <p>The spouse or common-law partner must report the amount transferred as income on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return, and may be able to <a href="">claim a deduction</a> for this amount.</p>
      
      <h4>Claim the deduction</h4>
      <p>The spouse or common-law partner will claim the deduction on the amount transferred on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>line 20800</strong> if transferred to their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Pooled Registered Pension Plan">PRPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Specified Pension Plan">SPP</abbr></li>
        <li><strong>line 23200</strong> if transferred to their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> or used to purchase an annuity</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- <p>Claim the amount from box 18 as a deduction on <strong>line 20800</strong>.</p> -->

      <!-- <p><a href="#claim-un">Claim the deduction for rollover to a spouse or common-law partner</a></p> -->
    
      <h4>Change in value after the date of death</h4>
      <p>If there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> between the date of death and the transfer, it will be included in box 16. The spouse or common-law partner reports this on line 11500 and claims the deduction on line 20800 or 23200 if applicable.</p>
      <p>If there is a <strong>decrease</strong> in the value of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> between the date of death and the transfer, it will not affect the box 16 amount. Instead, the legal representative may <a href="#h-3">claim a line 23200 deduction on the decrease in value</a>.</p>

        <p>A child or grandchild of an annuitant, where before the annuitant's death, were living with them <strong>and</strong> met <strong>1</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>net income for the previous year (line 23600 of the T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return) was less than the basic personal amount (line 30000 of the T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return) for that previous year</li>
          <li>financial dependence is due to a mental or physical infirmity and your net income for the previous year was equal to or less than the basic personal amount, <strong>plus</strong> the disability amount (line 31600 of the T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return) for that previous year</li>

      <h4>Transfer is not limited by the usual <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit</h4>
      <p>Amounts transferred from a deceased annuitant's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> to qualifying survivors are not subject to the qualifying survivor's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limits if the transfers:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>were made to the qualifying survivors' <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Pooled Registered Pension Plan">PRPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Specified Pension Plan">SPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> or used to buy them an annuity</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>do not exceed the fair market value of the deceased's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> when the annuitant died plus any income earned in the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> before December 31 of the year following the death</li>

      </ul>
      <p>In addition, if the transfer is made to the qualifying survivor's <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> or <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr>, it must be:</p>

      <p>If amounts earned in the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> after December 31 of the year following the death were included in a transfer, they might not qualify for the deduction (not considered a designated benefit). If this is the case, <a href="#contact-bank-rrif-type">consult your financial institution about amounts that might not qualify</a>.</p>
      <p>When filing their T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return, the qualifying survivor should:</p>

      <p>If there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of the <abbr title="Registered Retirement Income Fund">RRIF</abbr> between the date of death and the transfer, the increase will be included in box 22 or box 16.
