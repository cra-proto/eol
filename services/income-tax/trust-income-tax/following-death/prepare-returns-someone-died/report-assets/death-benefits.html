               <p>A death benefit from an employer is an amount you receive after a person's death for their employment service. The amount typically goes to a beneficiary, but can also go to the estate.</p>

                                      <p>The estate may receive a payment as a result of the employee's death to recognize the employee's service in an office or employment. This is considered income and a T3 Trust Income and Information Return needs to be filed. Such a payment is usually from the deceased person's employer or from a trust fund the employer established. This payment may qualify as a death benefit, and the trust may be able to exclude up to $10,000 of the amount from income.<p>

                        <p>If you distribute the total death benefit to a single beneficiary according to the provisions of the will, the beneficiary may be able to exclude up to $10,000 of the payment from income. Enter on line 935, the amount from line 926 eligible for this exclusion.</p>

                        <p>If you distribute the total death benefit to more than one beneficiary, split the amount eligible for this exclusion among those beneficiaries. The total eligible amount that is split cannot exceed $10,000. The beneficiaries can use this information to calculate the taxable portion that they have to report on their personal tax returns.</p>

                        <p>If you exclude the eligible death benefit from the trust's income, only the taxable portion flows out to the beneficiary. Report only the taxable portion of the death benefit on line 11 of the T3 Trust Income and Information return.</p>
                        <p>If no one other than a trust received a death benefit, report the amount that is more than $10,000. Even if the trust did not receive all of the death benefits in one year, the total tax-free amount for all years cannot exceed $10,000. To find out what to report if anyone else received a death benefit for the same person, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it508r.html>">archived Interpretation Bulletin IT-508R, Death Benefits.</a></p>

               <h2>CPP or QPP death benefit</h2>

               <p>The Canada Pension Plan/Quebec Pension Plan (CPP/QPP) death benefit is reported by the beneficary on their personal income tax return or on a T3 Trust Income and Information return. It is <strong> not</strong> reported on the final tax return 70(1).</p>
               <p>Unlike a death benefit that an employer may pay to the estate or to a named beneficiary, the CPP or QPP benefit is not eligible for the $10,000 death benefit exemption. </p>

               <h3>Did the estate receive the CPP/QPP death benefit?</h3>
               <details>
                   <summary>Yes and it is the <strong>only income</strong> of the estate</summary>

<dd>T4A (P), Statement of Canada Pension Plan Benefits</dd>
<dt>Report on line</dt>
<dd>13000 of the beneficiary's income tax return</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the CPP or QPP death benefit is the only income of the estate and a T3 return is not otherwise required to be filed, the death benefit can be reported directly on the T1 return of the beneficiary of the estate.</p>

                </details>

     </dl>
     <p>If the CPP or QPP death benefit is payable to a beneficiary in the year it is received by the estate, a T3 slip will be issued in the beneficiary's name and the beneficiary will be required to include the amount on their T1 return. The estate does not have the option to elect to have the benefit taxed in the estate if the estate otherwise has taxable income.</p>

     <p>If the CPP or QPP death benefit is not paid or made payable to a beneficiary in the year it is received by the estate, the amount will be included in the estate’s taxable income reported on its T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return in the year it is received by the estate and the estate will pay tax on that amount.</p>
