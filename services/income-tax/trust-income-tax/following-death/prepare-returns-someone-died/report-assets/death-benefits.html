<p>Death benefits are income either of the estate or the beneficiary who receives it and who it comes from. This determines where the death benefit amount needs to be reported.</p>

     <li><a href="#h-1">Death benefit from an employer</a></li>
     <li><a href="#h-2">CPP or QPP death benefit</a></li>

        </ul>
        </ul>
               <h2>Death benefit from an employer</h2>
               <p>A death benefit from an employer is an amount you receive after a person's death for their employment service. The amount typically goes to a beneficiary, but can also go to the estate.</p>
               <h3 id="h-2a">Beneficiary receives employer death benefit from employer or estate</h3>

                 <dd>Line 13000 on the beneficary's personal income tax form</dd>
               </dl>

               <p>Up to $10,000 of the total of all death benefits paid (other than CPP or QPP death benefits) is not taxable. For more information on how to report a death benefit that an employer pays on a personal tax return, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-13000-other-income/line-13000-death-benefits-other-than-canada-quebec-pension-plan-death-benefits.html">line 13000 - Other income - death benefits.</a></p>

               <h3 id="h-2a">Estate receives employer death benefit</h3>


              <p>The estate may receive a payment as a result of the employee's death to recognize the employee's service in an office or employment. this is considered income and a T3 Trust Income and Information Return needs to be filed. Such a payment is usually from the deceased person's employer or from a trust fund the employer established. This payment may qualify as a death benefit, and the trust may be able to exclude up to $10,000 of the amount from income.<p>

<p>If you allocate the total death benefit to a single beneficiary according to the provisions of the will, the beneficiary may be able to exclude up to $10,000 of the payment from income. Enter on line 935, the amount from line 926 eligible for this exclusion.</p>

<p>If you allocate the total death benefit to more than one beneficiary, apportion the amount eligible for this exclusion among those beneficiaries. The total eligible amount apportioned cannot exceed $10,000. The beneficiaries can use this information to calculate the taxable portion that they have to report on their T1 returns.</p>

<p>If you exclude the eligible death benefit from the trust's income, only the taxable portion flows out to the beneficiary. Report only the taxable portion of the death benefit on line 11 of the T3 return.</p>
<p>If no one other than a trust received a death benefit, report the amount that is more than $10,000. Even if the trust did not receive all of the death benefits in one year, the total tax-free amount for all years cannot exceed $10,000. To find out what to report if anyone else received a death benefit for the same person, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it508r.html>">archived Interpretation Bulletin IT-508R, Death Benefits.</a></p>

               <h2>CPP or QPP death benefit</h2>

               <p>Where the Canada Pension Plan/Quebec Pension Plan (CPP) death benefit is reported depends on who receives it.</p>

               <h3>The CPP/QPP death benefit is part of other income of the estate</h3>

                 <dd>line 19 of the T3 for the year the payment is received</dd>
               </dl>
               <p>Unlike a death benefit that an employer may pay to the estate or to a named beneficiary, the CPP or QPP benefit is not eligible for the $10,000 death benefit exemption. </p>
              <p>For detailed information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/taxation-cpp-qpp-death-benefit-amounts.html">Reporting a CPP/QPP death benefit amount.</a> </p>

                <h3>The CPP/QPP death benefit is the only income of the estate</h3>

                  <dd>line 13000 of beneficiary's personal income tax return</dd>
                </dl>
              <p>In the case that the death benefit is the only income of the estate and a T3 return does not have to otherwise be filed, the death benefit amount should be reported by the beneficary. Do not include it on the final return 70(1).</p>

               <h3 id="h-2a">The beneficary receives the CPP/QPP death benefit</h3>
               <dl class="dl-horizontal">

                 <dd>line 13000 of beneficiary's personal income tax return</dd>
               </dl>
               <p>If the CPP or QPP death benefit is payable to a beneficiary in the year it is received by the estate and the estate needs to file a T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return, a T3 slip will be issued in the beneficiary's name. The beneficiary will be required to include the amount on their personal income tax return.</p>
