Instead, the disposition must be reported and the designation may be made by the surviving spouse, common-law partner, or the trust at the earlier of the time of actual disposition or death of the surviving spouse.</p>
                  <p>A record should be kept of the years for which the deceased individual would have been eligible to make a principal residence designation for the particular property.</p>
