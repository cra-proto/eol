                  <summary>Maintaining a principal residence status after the date of death</summary>
                  <p>Generally, a principal residence <strong>no longer qualifies</strong> as a principal residence after the date of death.</p>
                  <p>The beneficiary of the estate might need to take into account capital gains from the date of death in future returns.</p>
                  <p>However, a property might qualify as the principal residence of a trust. Refer to 2.66.1 of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-3-family-unit-issues/income-tax-folio-s1-f3-c2-principal-residence.html">Income Tax Folio S1-F3-C2, Principal Residence</a>.</p>

                  <p>Where the principal residence is transferred to the deceased’s spouse, common-law partner, or testamentary spousal or common-law partner trust (under the conditions described in the next section), the CRA does not require you to make a principal residence designation for the period before death. Instead, the disposition must be reported and the designation may be made by the surviving spouse, common-law partner, or the trust at the earlier of the time of actual disposition or death of the surviving spouse.</p>
                  <p>A record should be kept of the years for which the deceased individual would have been eligible to make a principal residence designation for the particular property.</p>

               <p>If any property, investments or belongings are sold <strong>after the date of death</strong>, including the principal residence, before being passed onto a beneficiary, you must report the capital gain in line 1 of a T3 Trust Tax and Information Return for the estate.</p>
               <p>Any investments in a TFSA might also need to be reported for gains after the date of death, as they lose their tax-free status. Refer to <a href="tax-free-savings-account.html">Tax-Free Savings Accounts</a></p>

               <h3 id="h-3a">Capital losses in the T3 can be carried back to the final personal return</h3>
               <p>If there is a net capital loss as a result of disposing of depreciable property held in trust, you may elect to carry back this loss to the final return.</p>
               <p>Usually, you would claim these losses on the trust's <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return</a>. However, in the&nbsp;first tax year of a deceased person's graduated rate estate, you can&nbsp;elect to&nbsp;treat all or part of these losses as losses of the deceased on the deceased's <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/final-return.html">final return</a>.</p>
               <p>A net capital loss realized in this first tax year cannot be applied to any tax year before the year of death.</p>
