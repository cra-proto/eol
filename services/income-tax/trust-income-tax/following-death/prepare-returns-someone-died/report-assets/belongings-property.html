                  <summary>Maintaining a principal residence status after the date of death</summary>
                  <p>Generally, a principal residence <strong>no longer qualifies</strong> as a principal residence after the date of death.</p>
                  <p>The beneficiary of the estate might need to take into account capital gains from the date of death in future returns.</p>
                  <p>However, a property might qualify as the principal residence of a trust. Refer to 2.66.1 of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-3-family-unit-issues/income-tax-folio-s1-f3-c2-principal-residence.html">Income Tax Folio S1-F3-C2, Principal Residence</a>.</p>

                  <p>Where the principal residence is transferred to the deceased’s spouse, common-law partner, or testamentary spousal or common-law partner trust (under the conditions described in the next section), the CRA does not require you to make a principal residence designation for the period before death. Instead, the disposition must be reported and the designation may be made by the surviving spouse, common-law partner, or the trust at the earlier of the time of actual disposition or death of the surviving spouse.</p>
                  <p>A record should be kept of the years for which the deceased individual would have been eligible to make a principal residence designation for the particular property.</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>determine how much of the selling price relates to the land and how much is for the building</li>

               <p>For more information, see <a href="#P1992_91847">Selling a building in 2021</a>.</p>
               <p>Special rules may also apply if you dispose of, or are considered to have disposed of, a property that was your principal residence for 1994 and for which you or your spouse or common-law partner has filed <span class="nowrap">Form T664</span> or T664(Seniors), Election to Report a Capital Gain on Property Owned at the End of <span class="nowrap">February 22, 1994</span>. If this is your situation, see <a href="#P4301_156490">Disposing of your principal residence</a>.</p>
               <p>The CRA&nbsp;may reassess an income tax and benefit return beyond the normal reassessment period in the following situations:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>you do not report in your income tax and benefit return a sale or other disposition of real estate in the year</li>
                  <li>you do not file an income tax&nbsp;and benefit return for the year in which a disposition of the real or immovable property occurs and&nbsp;the CRA&nbsp;issues an assessment of tax</li>
                  <li>you owned property directly or indirectly through a partnership and the partnership did not report the sale or other disposition on <span class="nowrap">Form T5013</span>, Partnership Information Return, if it was required to file one</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Under this extended reassessment period, the reassessment is limited to amounts reasonably relating to the unreported or previously unreported disposition of real estate. Where the disposition is by a corporation or partnership, the extended reassessment period applies only if the property is a capital property of the corporation or the partnership.</p> -->

               <!-- <h4>Personal-use property</h4> -->
               <p>When you sell personal-use property, such as cars and boats, in most cases you do not end up with a capital gain. This is because this type of property usually does not increase in value over the years. As a result, you may end up with a loss. Although you have to report any gain on the sale of personal-use property, generally you are not allowed to claim a loss.</p>
               <p>For more information, see <a href="#P941_72799">Personal-use property</a>.</p>

               <h4>Valuable belongings</h4>
               <p>Capital gains must be reported in the personal income tax return 70(1) on belongings that increase in value, such as paintings or works of art, jewelry, stamp or coin collections, some types of automobiles and antiques.</p>

               <!-- <p class="small"><strong>Personal income tax return</strong></p> -->
               <p>Capital gains on investments made outside of a registered plan or TFSA must be reported as part of the final personal return 70(1). This includes capital gains on:</p>
               <ul>

                  <li>mutual funds</li>

               <h2 id="h-3">Calculate capital gains</h2>
               <p>To calculate any capital gain or loss, you need to know the following&nbsp;3 amounts:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the proceeds of disposition</li>
                  <li>the adjusted cost base (<abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr>)</li>
                  <li>the outlays and expenses incurred to sell your property</li>
               </ul>
               <p>To calculate your capital gain or loss, subtract the total of your property's <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr>, and any outlays and expenses incurred to sell your property, from the proceeds of disposition.</p>
               <p>For further details and special circumstnaces, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4037/capital-gains.html#P298_31900">T4037 - Capital Gains - 2021</a></p>

               <!-- <p class="small"><strong>T3 trust income tax return</strong></p> -->
               <p>If any property, investments or belongings are sold <strong>after the date of death</strong>, including the principal residence, before being passed onto a beneficiary, you must report the capital gain in line 1 of a T3 Trust Tax and Information Return for the estate.</p>
               <p>Any investments in a TFSA might also need to be reported for gains after the date of death, as they lose their tax-free status. Refer to <a href="tax-free-savings-account.html">Tax-Free Savings Accounts</a></p>

               <h3 id="h-4a">Capital losses in the T3 can be carried back to the final personal return</h3>
               <p>If there is a net capital loss as a result of disposing of depreciable property held in trust, you may elect to carry back this loss to the final return.</p>
               <p>Usually, you would claim these losses on the trust's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return</a>. However, in the&nbsp;first tax year of a deceased person's graduated rate estate, you can&nbsp;elect to&nbsp;treat all or part of these losses as losses of the deceased on the deceased's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/final-return.html">final return</a>.</p>
               <p>A net capital loss realized in this first tax year cannot be applied to any tax year before the year of death.</p>
