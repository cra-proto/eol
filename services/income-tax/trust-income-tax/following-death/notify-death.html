            <h2 id="h-2">Additional help to cancel or transfer benefits</h2>
            <p>Generally, by reporting the date of death to the CRA, benefits payments will be appropriately managed, however, in some cases, you might need to take further steps to ensure they are cancelled or transferred:</p>

            <details>
                <summary>GST/HST credit</summary>
                <!-- Generally, GST/HST credit payments are issued on the fifth day of the month in July, October, January, and April. If the fifth day falls on a weekend or a federal statutory holiday, the payment will be made on the last business day before that day.  -->
                <p>If the person who died was receiving GST/HST credit payments, the CRA may still send out a payment after the date of death because they are not aware of the death. If this happens, you should return the payment to the tax centre that serves your area.</p>

                <h3>Deceased was single, separated, divorced, or widowed</h3>
                <p>If the recipient died before the scheduled month in which the CRA issues the GST/HST credit, payments will no longer be issued in that person’s name or to that person’s estate.</p>
                <p>If the recipient died during or after the scheduled month in which the CRA issues the credit and the payment has not been cashed, return it to the CRA so that they can send the payment to the person's estate.</p>
                <p>If the person who died was getting a credit for a child, the child's new caregiver should contact the CRA at 1-800-387-1193, as they may qualify to receive GST/HST credit payments for that child.</p>

                <h3>Deceased received the credit for both themselves and their spouse or common-law partner</h3>
                <p>The deceased's spouse or common-law partner may now be eligible to receive the GST/HST credit if they filed an income tax and benefit return. The GST/HST credit payments will be based on their net income alone.</p>

                <h3>Deceased's spouse or common-law partner received the credit for both themselves and the deceased</h3>
                <p>The payments will be recalculated based on the surviving spouse's or common-law partner's net income and will only include a claim for them and any eligible children, if applicable.</p>

                <h3>Deceased is an eligible child for whom the credit was paid</h3>
                <p>Entitlement to GST/HST credit payments for a child who died stops the quarter after the child's date of death. You should notify the CRA of the date of death so that the CRA can update their records.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) advance payments</summary>
                <p>A deceased person with a date of death between January 1 and June 30 is <strong>not</strong> eligible for the Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) in the year of death.</p>
                <p>If the deceased received advance payments, a repayment might need to be made.</p>
                <p>The benefit for the final year up to the death must be claimed on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-45300-canada-workers-benefit-cwb.html">line 45300</a> in the T1 final return for the deceased.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Canada Child Benefit (CCB) payments for a child</summary>
                <p>If the person who died was receiving CCB payments, including payments from related provincial or territorial child benefit and credit programs, and the surviving spouse or common-law partner is the child’s parent, the CRA will usually transfer the CCB payments to that person.<p>

                <h3>Apply as a new recipient of the benefit who is not the parent</h3>
                <p>If anyone other than the parent, is now primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of the child, that person will have to apply for benefit payments for the child through one of the following options:<p>
                <ul>
                    <li>By using the "Apply for child benefits" online service on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a></li>
                    <li>By completing and sending to the CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc66.html">Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits Application</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the person who died was receiving payments under provincial or territorial child benefit and credit programs administered by the CRA, there is no need to apply separately to qualify. The CRA will use the information from the application to determine the new caregiver's eligibility for these programs.</p>

                <h3>Deceased's spouse or common-law partner received the benefit for both themselves and the deceased</h3>
                <p>If the surviving spouse or common-law partner receives CCB payments, the CRA will automatically recalculate the payments excluding the net income of the person who died when the CRA is notified of the death.</p>

                <h3>Deceased is an eligible child for whom the benefit was paid</h3>
                <p>Eligibility for CCB payments stops after the child's date of death.</p>
            </details>



            <h2 id="h-3">Contact other government agencies to notify about the death</h2>
            <p>In addition to the CRA, when someone dies, there are other departments and agencies you might need to contact:</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/notify-government-death.html" rel="external">Notify other federal departments and agencies of the death</a></p>

	    <h2 id="h-4">Access tax records or details on benefits of the deceased</h2>
	    <p>The legal representative has access to tax information of the deceased. To determine who is the legal representative and authorize other representatives, refer to <a href="represent-someone-died.html">Represent someone who died</a>.</p>
