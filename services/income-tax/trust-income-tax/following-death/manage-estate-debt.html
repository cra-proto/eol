        <p>If the estate of someone who died has more debts than assets, there might be situations where the estate cannot finish paying tax debts or other debts, and the estate will not be distributed to beneficiaries.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#h_1">Ensure you file the final tax returns</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_2">Resolve debts up to the value of the estate</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_3">Plans with specified beneficiaries might not be liable for estate debts</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_4">Leave the estate open and keep records of the estate</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="h_1">Ensure you filed the final tax return</h2>
        <p>Even if the estate will not be able to pay amounts owing on from the tax assessment, you must still file the final tax return on behalf of the person who died.</p>
        <ul><li><a href="prepare-returns-someone-died.html">File the returns the final returns</a></li></ul>

        <h2 id="h_2">Resolve debts up to the value of the estate</h2>
        <p>You must resolve any debts of the estate up to the value of the estate.</p>
        <ul><li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments-cra/individual-payments.html">Pay all outstanding debts to the CRA</a></li></ul>
        <p>The legal representative and other beneficiaries are not personally liable for the estate’s debts to the CRA unless the estate’s assets are distributed before debts are paid.</p>
        <p>Debts to creditors other than the CRA should be consulted according to the relevant provincial or third party authority.</p>
          
        <details>
          <summary>Tax debts have priority over unsecured creditors but pay any funeral or estate administration fees first</summary>
          <p>Debts should generally paid in the following order of priority:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Secured creditors are paid, to the extent of the value of the asset over which they have security. If there is a deficiency,(i.e. the value of the asset is less than the debt owing) the secured creditor will rank with the other unsecured creditors with respect to the deficiency;</li>
            <li>Reasonable funeral and testamentary expenses incurred by the legal executor or administrator of the deceased;</li>
            <li>The costs of administration, including the expenses and fees of the executor or administrator, property taxes, insurance fees, and legal costs;</li>
            <li>Debts that have legislative priority over unsecured creditors, for example, maintenance for children, rent owing to a landlord, or wages, salaries or commissions owing to an employee of the deceased, debts owing pursuant to the Income Tax Act, or debts owing as a result of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act;</li>
            <li>All other unsecured debtors, including claims of the Crown in right of Canada or of any province that do not have legislative priority, are then to be paid. If there are insufficient funds, they are paid ratably.</li>
          </ol>
        </details>

        <h2 id="h_3">Plans with specified beneficiaries might not be liable for estate debts</h2>
        <p>Some plans, such as for life insurance or registered plans (such as RRSPs) might have specified beneficiaries and will be paid directly to the beneficiary.</p>
        <p>In the case a payment is made directly to the beneficiary, it is not part of the estate, nor liable for debts of the estate. Consult with the insurance company or financial institution on the terms of each plan.</p>

        <h2 id="h_4">Leave the estate open and keep records of the estate</h2>
        <p>If the estate can not resolve all debts, you will not be able to apply for a clearance certificate nor distribute assets.</p>
        <p>Generally, there is no further action required on the part of the legal representative after filing the return and paying debts up to the value of the estate.</p>
        <p>The estate will remain on file with the CRA, while you should keep all your records of the estate on file. In the event that the estate receives income in future tax years, you must <a href="">report the income on a T3 Trust Income Tax return</a> and continue to repay any liabilities before making distributions.</p>
