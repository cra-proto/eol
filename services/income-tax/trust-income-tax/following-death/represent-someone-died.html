<h2 id="h_1">Determine who is representing the person who died</h2>
<p>When someone dies, the CRA requires the filing of tax returns and the resolving of any outstanding balances owing of the person's account. This is done by a representative of the person who died.</p>
<p>The type of representative depends on if there is a will or no will.</p>
<h3>Types of representatives</h3>
<h4>Legal representative</h4>
<p>The legal representative is typically the executor named in the will who will be handling the estate. The estate is value of the financial assets, such as property and investments, and financial liabilities, such as balances owing to the CRA, of the person who died.</p>

<h4>Authorized representative</h4>
<p>An authorized representive is someone who can view, get information about and update the tax information for individuals or businesses. This is typically an accountant or a lawyer who would need access to the tax information. A person may also have more than one authorized representative.</p>
<p>The legal representative may also choose to appoint authorized representatives to manage the tax information on their behalf.</p>
<p>For additional information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/overview.html">authorize a representative.</a></p>
<details>
    <summary>If the person who died previously had authorized representatives</summary>

<p>If the person who died had authorized representatives for their tax account while they were alive, those authorized representatives will continue to be on the account until a legal representative requests their removal through<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client.</a></p>

</details>

<h3 id="h1_1a">Check if there is a will</h3>
<p>The will is typically where you will find information about who will represent the person who died and instructions on what to do with the esate.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Yes, there is a will

</summary>

<p>If you are the executor of a will, you are the legal representative of the person who died and responsible for the estate. In some cases, a court document may also be issued appointing an executor.</p>

<p>You will need to provide a copy of the will to the CRA to show that you are the legal representative. You can submit documents online through Represent a Client or mail in a copy to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html"a tax centre.</p>

<p>Signing up for RAC will also allow you to gain online access to the tax records for the person who died.</p>

<p>You need to sign up for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client (RAC)</a> to gain access to the tax records of the person who died. RAC will also allow you to submit a copy of the will showing you are the legal representative.</p>

    </details>


    <details>
        <summary>No, there is not a will</summary>

<p>If a person dies without a will (intestate), or there is no one named as an executor of the will, the provincial court of the residence of the person who died will usually appoint someone to be the legal representative to handle the estate (Certificate of Appointment).</p>

<p>This person is usually a spouse, common-law partner, or next of kin. </p>

<p>If the person dies without a will, and there is no court-appointed representative, you can request to be appointed a representative for CRA tax matters using form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc552.html">RC552 Appointing a Representative for a Deceased Person.</a> </p>

<p>Once your request has been approved, you will be an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client/responsibilities-authorized-representatives.html">authorized representative</a> who can view, get information about and update the tax information for the person who died. This approval is for CRA purposes only. </p>

    </details>

<h2 id="h_2">Responsibilities of the representative</h2>
<p>The representative of the person who died is responsible for the financial assets and liabilities of the person who died.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make sure <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/notify-government-death.html">CRA has been notified of the death</a></li>
  <li>provide the CRA with:
    <ul>
      <li>a copy of the death certificate</li>
      <li>a complete copy of the will or other legal document, such as grant of probate or letters of administration showing that you are the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/legal-representative.html">legal representative</a></li>
      <li>the current mailing address of the estate</li>
      <li>a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4111/request-canada-revenue-agency-update-records.html">Request for the Canada Revenue Agency to Update Records form</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>make sure the tax returns are filed for the person who died:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>any <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/prepare-returns-someone-died.html">returns for the year the person died</a></li>
      <li>any returns for previous years that the person who died did not file</li>
    </ul>
  <li>confirm the estate resolved all debts owing or find out how to <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/manage-estate-debt.html">manage an estate in debt</a>, as the legal representive can be held personally liable for unpaid amounts</li>
    <li><a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/clearance-certificate.html">applying for a clearance certificate</a>, as needed, before distributing any assets of the estate</li>
</ul>

<p>The social insurance number (SIN) of the person who died must be provided with any request or documents you are sending to the CRA.</p>

<h2 id="h_3">Access the tax records for someone who died</h2>
<p>You will need to submit documentation showing that you are the legal or authorize representative <strong>before</strong> you can access tax information.</p>
<h3>Online access</h3>
<p>Register for Represent a Client to submit the documents showing you are the legal or authorize representative online. After they have been submitted and verified, you can then use Represent a Client to access the tax records of someone who died.</p>

<h3>Phone access</h3>
<p> You will need to mail in the documents showing you are the legal or authorize representative.</p>
<p>You can also be authorized by the legal representative by completing and mailing in form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/aut-01.html">AUT-01 Authorize a Representative for Offline Access</a>. After the documents have been submitted and verified, you can access tax records over the phone only. You will need to sign up for Represent a Client for online access.</p>
<p>Mail any required documents to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a>.</p>
