<h2 id="h_1">Determine who is representing the person who died</h2>
<p>When someone dies, the CRA requires the filing of tax returns and the resolving of any outstanding tax debts of the person.</p>
<p>This is done by a representative of the person who died. The representative is typically the executor named in the will who will be handling the estate (the financial assets and liabilities of the person who died).</p>
<p>If there is no will, a representative is usually appointed by the provincial court to handle the estate.</p>
<p>These representatives are referred to as <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/legal-representative.html">legal representatives</a> because they have been appointed by an official document issued by a court. There can also be a CRA authorized representative to handle tax matters in certain cases where there is no legal representative in place.</p>
		<h3>Check if there is a a will</h3>

    <details>
        <summary>Yes, there is a will

</summary>

<p>If you are the executor of a will, you are the legal representative of the person who died and responsible for the estate. </p>

<p>The CRA will also then consider you an authorized representative, which allows you to view, get information about and update the tax information for the person who died. You can also appoint other people, such as an accountant or a lawyer as an additional authorized representative.</p>

<p>You will need to call the CRA to notify them that you are the legal representative. You will be asked to provide a copy of the will to show that you are the legal representative. </p>

<p>You need to sign up for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client (RAC)</a> to gain access to the tax records of the person who died. RAC will also allow you to submit a copy of the will showing you are the legal representative.</p>

    </details>


    <details>
        <summary>No, there is not a will</summary>

<p>If a person dies without a will (intestate), or there is no one named as an executor of the will, the provincial court of the residence of the person who died will usually appoint someone to be the legal representative to handle the estate (Certificate of Appointment).</p>

<p>This person is usually a spouse, common-law partner, or next of kin. </p>

<p>If the person dies without a will, and there is no court-appointed representative, you can request to be <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc552.html">appointed a representative for CRA tax matters.</a> </p>

<p>Once your request has been approved, you will be an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client/responsibilities-authorized-representatives.html">authorized representative</a> who can view, get information about and update the tax information for the person who died. This approval is for CRA purposes only. </p>

    </details>


<h3>Decide if you are going to authorize additional representatives</h3>
<p>f you are the legal representative, or have been authorized as a representative for tax purposes, you can also add additional <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client/responsibilities-authorized-representatives.html">authorized representatives.</a></p>

<p>This is typically an accountant or a lawyer who would need access to the tax information of the person who died.</p>



    <details>
        <summary>If the person who died was previously represented by someone else</summary>


<p>If the person who died had authorized representatives for their tax account while they were alive, those authorized representatives will continue to be on the account until a legal representative requests their removal.</p>

<p>You can sign up online, by phone or mail to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>.</p>

    </details>





<h2 id="h_2">Responsibilities of the representative</h2>
<p>As the representative of the person who died, you are responsible for the estate (the financial assets and liabilities) of the person who died. </p>
<ul>
  <li>make sure CRA has been notified of the death</li>
  <li>provide the CRA with:
    <ul>
      <li>a copy of the death certificate</li>
      <li>a complete copy of the will or other legal document, such as grant of probate or letters of administration showing that you are the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/legal-representative.html">legal representative</a></li>
      <li>the current mailing address of the estate</li>
      <li>a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4111/request-canada-revenue-agency-update-records.html">Request for the Canada Revenue Agency to Update Records form</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>make sure tax returns are filed for the person who died:</li>
      <ul>any <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/prepare-returns-someone-died.html">returns for the year the person died</a></ul>
      <ul>any returns for previous years that the person who died did not file</ul>
    </li>
  <li>confirm the estate resolved all debts owing or find out how to <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/manage-estate-debt.html">manage an estate in debt</a>, as the legal representive can be held personally liable for unpaid amounts</li>
  <li>
  <li><a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/clearance-certificate.html">apply for a clearance certificate</a>, as needed, before distributing any assets of the estate</li>
</ul>

<p>The social insurance number (SIN) of the person who died must be provided with any request or documents you are sending to the CRA.</p>

<h2 id="h_3">Sign up for Represent a Client (RAC)</h2>
<p>You must register for Represent a Client (RAC) before sending copies of the legal documents.</p>

<p>When you register for RAC, you will be assigned a representative identifier (RepID). You will need this number to submit your documents. </p>

<p>Represent a Client is also where you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/overview.html">appoint additional authorized representatives</a> to deal with the CRA for tax matters on your behalf.</p>

<p>Before you register, make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a copy of the will, if one exists</li>
<li>applied to be appointed a representative for the person who died, if no will exists</li>
<li>the social insurance number of the person who died</li>
<li>your social insurance number you will use to sign up for RAC</li>
