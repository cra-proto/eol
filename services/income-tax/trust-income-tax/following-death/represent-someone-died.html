        <p>When someone dies, the legal representative is responsible for the administration of the estate of the person who died. The estate includes the assets, such as property and investments, and liabilities, such as balances owing to the CRA, of the person who died.</p>
        <p>The legal representative of the estate needs to make sure that tax returns are filed and  any balances owing are paid before distributing the estate.</p>

            <p>The legal representative is typically the executor named in the will who will be handling the estate. The responsibilities of the legal representative includes making sure that tax returns are filed and any balances owing to the CRA are paid before distributing the estate.</p>

            <p>In Québec, you are the legal representative if you are registered as the <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/citizens/your-situation/liquidators-of-a-succession-steps-to-follow-after-a-death/">liquidator of the estate</a>  and may have additional administrative duties.</p>

              <p>If a person dies without a will (intestate), or an executor has not been named in a will, certain individuals can apply through the courts to administer the estate. Check with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/estate-planning/resources-estate-law.html">estate law of provincial or territorial government</a> of the residence of the person who died for more information.</p>
              <p>If there is no court-appointed representative or you are waiting for an appointment from the court, you can request to be appointed as a representative for CRA matters using form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc552.html">RC552 Appointing a Representative for a Deceased Person</a>. </p>
              <p>Once your request has been approved, you will be authorized as a representative who can view, get information about and update the tax information for the person who died. This approval is for CRA purposes only and not for other administrative responsibilities outside the CRA.</p>

        <h2 id="h_3b">Authorize additional representatives</h3>
        <p>As the legal representative, you can also authorize additional representatives, such as accountants or lawyers and grant them access to the tax records of the person who died.</p>

        <h3>For online access to tax records</h3>
        <p>There are two ways to authorize online access to additional representatives:</p>
        <details>
          <summary>The legal representative adds an additional representative from their Represent a Client</summary>

          <ol>
            <li>In Represent a Client, enter the SIN of the person who died to access their online tax account</li>

            <li>In the ‘Related services’ section, select Authorized representative(s)</li>
            <li>Select ‘Authorize a new representative’ and follow the instructions to add one or more
              additional representatives</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You will need the authorized representative’s RepID, Business number or GroupID</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you complete the steps to add them, you will receive a confirmation and they will
              have immediate online and offline access to the account</li>
            </ol>

          </details>
        <details>
          <summary>The additional representative submits an authorization request through their Represent a Client</summary>
          <ol>
            <li>The additional representative must submit an authorization request through their
              Represent a Client account</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An additional representative cannot submit an authorization request in
                  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html" target="_blank">Represent a Client</a> for a person who died until the CRA has been notified who
                  the legal representative is, and the documents have been processed</li>
                </ul>
            <li>The authorization request generates a signature page with a reference number, that needs to be printed by the additional representative and signed by the legal representative</li>
            <li>The additional representative will need to submit the signed signature page using the
              “Submit documents” service in their Represent a Client account
                <ul>
                  <li>Do not mail or fax a copy of the signature page to the CRA, as it will not be
                    processed nor returned to you</li>
                </ul>
            <li>You, as the legal representative, may be contacted by the CRA to verify the additional
              representative’s authorization request</li>

</details>
        <h3>For offline access to tax records (mail, phone, or fax)</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Authorize a representative for offline access</summary>
          <ol>
