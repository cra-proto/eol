          <p>When someone dies, the responsibility of filing a final return and ensuring debts are resolved falls on their legal representative.</p>
          <p>As the legal representative, you are authorised to access the tax records of the deceased and file returns on their behalf.</p>
          <p>The legal representative can also authorize a representative, such as an accountant, to help them prepare tax returns.</p>
